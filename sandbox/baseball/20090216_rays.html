<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>Who knew that all it would take to turn around the constant cellar dweller in Tampa was an exorcism? The Rays -- don't you dare use that "D" word -- put 10 years of futility behind them last year on their way to the AL championship. Not a bad run for a team that had finished last every year of its existence except one. It was no fluke, either. This team has been built to compete for years to come with a nucleus of young and talented players. 
<P>Tampa Bay's top move this offseason was adding Pat Burrell, who was last seen helping the Phillies clinch the World Series over the Rays. Burrell provides a veteran power bat to the middle of the lineup. The team also traded from its pitching surplus and sent Edwin Jackson to Detroit for Matt Joyce, a 24-year-old who hit 12 homers in 242 at-bats for the Tigers last year.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>What's the right price for Tampa's young pitching stud?</b> 
<p>The Rays have found themselves with a handful of players who could fit that description, but we're talking about the youngest and studliest: David Price. He was unflappable during five September outings (1.93 ERA, 0.93 WHIP in 14 innings) and five postseason appearances (1.59 ERA, 1.15 WHIP in 5.2 innings). The first pick in the 2007 draft, Price is considered the top prospect in baseball by a number of scouts, and he should be an immediate fantasy producer. But how much are you willing to risk to get a 23-year-old who has pitched just 130 innings total since turning pro? My guess is his stock will only rise as we approach opening day and the hype builds, so it might take a 10th- or 11th-round pick to land Price.
<p><b>HITTERS</B> 
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Evan Longoria. Longoria homered 27 times -- once every 16.6 at-bats -- as a 22-year-old rookie, and now he's viewed as the top third baseman after Alex Rodriguez and David Wright are off the board. (Remember, Ryan Braun and Miguel Cabrera no longer qualify there.) Superstitious owners will worry about a sophomore slump. Optimistic ones will hope he follows Dustin Pedroia's lead of jumping from Rookie of the Year to MVP.
<br/><b>Others:</b> OF B.J. Upton, OF Carl Crawford
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Carlos Pena. Pena isn't necessarily someone to shy away from on draft day. Although he failed to approach 46 homers last year -- who really expected him to repeat that? -- he did hit 31 and drove in 102 runs. The thing to know is that if you do come away with Pena as your first baseman, be prepared for a slow start. He's a .210 career hitter in April, and he hit .198 in that month last season (although with six homers, at least).
<br/><b>Others:</b> OF Pat Burrell
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Dioner Navarro. Navarro (.295) finished fifth among starting backstops in batting average last year. The reason everyone isn't clamoring to land him at the draft is he hit a pedestrian seven homers (tied for 22nd at the position). The encouraging part is his slugging percentage rose more than 50 points from the previous year. He's also just 25, so those power numbers have room to grow. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> OF Matt Joyce
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Jason Bartlett. The shortstop isn't going to fill a stat sheet with his work at the plate, but he is going to contribute in one very important category once on base. Bartlett is one of only 11 AL players who has swiped 20-plus bases in each of the past two seasons. The bonus is Bartlett won't cost the early pick that an Ian Kinsler or Brian Roberts will.

<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B> 
<p><b>Must Own:</b> James Shields. Scott Kazmir's sexy K/9 rate (9.7 career) makes him the first Tampa Bay pitcher off the board, but Shields has been the better producer the past two seasons according to SN's <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/analyzer/>Player Analyzer</a>. Even after consecutive seasons with 215 innings pitched, Shields doesn't carry Kazmir's durability concerns. The moral of this story: Kazmir is nice, but you get more bang for your fantasy buck with Shields.
<br/><b>Others:</b> SP Scott Kazmir
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Troy Percival. Percival is old and fragile. I tried to think of a nicer way to put it, but let's face facts. The guy will turn the big 4-0 this summer. Aside from being over the hill, he hasn't been on the hill for 50 innings in a season since '02. He did save 28 games for Tampa Bay last year, so you can't totally ignore him. But Joe Maddon has already said he'll use a "group effort when necessary" to close. That's why Percival is near the bottom ranks of "full-time" closers.
<br /><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Matt Garza. If a guy has won an ALCS MVP trophy, can he still be considered a "sleeper?" He can when his regular-season stats, while solid, still have room for improvement -- particularly the wins (11) and Ks (128 in 184.2 innings). Garza got off to a slow start with the Rays (7.62 ERA in April) before settling in as the team's third starter. Expect him to take yet another step forward this year. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> SP David Price
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Andy Sonnanstine. Some experts view Sonnanstine as a potential breakout candidate for '09 after his strong finish last season (3.16 ERA, 26 Ks, 8 BBs in September). Whether or not you're considering him in the final rounds of your mixed league, know that Sonnanstine is bound to be a decent choice in AL-only formats, and not simply because he pitches for a contender.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> B.J. Upton might not be ready for opening day as his surgically repaired shoulder heals. Although it's something that should be factored into his value, it's certainly not a deal breaker in most leagues. SN's salary cap games would be an exception. Why waste the roster spot with someone who won't be contributing? If you really want Upton, you can add him once he's back in the lineup and after his price has dipped a little.

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> Pat Burrell is the kind of slugger who costs a couple bucks more in points leagues than in 5x5 formats (as long as strikeouts aren't penalized) because of his strong OBP (career .367). Burrell is a .257 career hitter who has hit above .260 only twice in nine seasons, but he has hit at least 29 homers in each of the past four years and isn't scared to take a walk. 
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> This team should have a number of good values (Upton, Crawford, Shields and Garza, to name a few), but there is one top-dollar player you might let someone else pay for: Kazmir. Again, he's a fine pitcher, but in the heat of the bidding, owners tend to focus on the strikeout hype and name recognition and forget the durability concerns. He could be worth it, but he also could be a costly mistake.
<p><i>For the Rays' projected dollar values, <a href= http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/rays/dollarvalues/>click here.</a></i>
<p><b>Prospect Watch:</B> Reid Brignac's steady rise through the Rays' system hit a plateau last year at Triple-A Durham. The shortstop hit .250-9-43 in 97 games and was hitless in 10 at-bats in the majors. At 23, Brignac has time on his side, and this franchise has been more than patient with its prospects in the past. A strong season at Durham could lead to a second-half call-up and first dibs on the 2010 starting job.
<p><b>Ballpark factor:</b> Tropicana Field went from being ranked the eighth best hitters park in SN's ballpark rankings to one that saw the sixth fewest runs scored in 2008. That's what happens when your team's bullpen trims its 6.16 ERA. Where should the Trop fall on the hitter/pitcher spectrum for '09? Consider it neutral, another reason to be concerned about Burrell's move out of Philly.
