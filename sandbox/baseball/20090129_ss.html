<p><b><li><a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/rankings/ss/>Complete SS rankings</a></b>
<P>Larry, Curly and Moe. Huey, Dewey and Louie. Alvin, Simon and Theodore. 
<P>All are no doubt dynamic trios, but they have nothing on the fantasy triumvirate of Hanley Ramirez, Jose Reyes and Jimmy Rollins. For the third straight year Ramirez, Reyes and Rollins are the top three shortstops. 
<P>Fantasy owners no doubt will be penciling in the "three R's" early. But what about those who miss out?   
<P>Try Michael, Jhonny and Rafael. 
<P>No, we're not referencing Ninja Turtles. We're talking Michael Young, Jhonny Peralta and Rafael Furcal. 
<P>Young, a top-10 player at this position for three straight years, is the best of the consolation prizes. He'll be moving to third base, but he'll be eligible at shortstop this year.  Sure, his average dipped below .300 for the first time since 2002. But he still finished second among shortstops in RBIs (82), and hitting in Rangers Ballpark always has its advantages.
<P>Peralta led all shortstops with 89 RBIs in 2008, and has hit 20-plus home runs in three of the last four seasons. He also improved his average (.295) after the All-Star break. Bottom line: Peralta is showing consistency. 
<P>Furcal is entrenched in the top 10 here for the third straight year. He missed most of last season with a back injury, but his .357 average and 34 runs in 36 games sparked the Dodgers' playoff push. Furcal is back with Los Angeles and will be a key fantasy piece in 2009. 
<P><B>3 UP</B>
<P><B>1. Mike Aviles, Royals.</B> Perhaps the best shortstop you've never heard of. Aviles' rookie line (.325-10-51) is inviting when you consider that it came in 102 games with the Royals. Look for the youngster to build on last season's strong second half (.332-6-30). 
<P><B>2. J.J. Hardy, Brewers.</B> The ultimate hot-and-cold play, Hardy has 50 homers over the past two seasons. The good news was that he showed a little more consistency before and after the All-Star break last season. If Hardy puts it all together, he'll be a great fantasy play for years to come.
<P><B>3. Troy Tulowitzki, Rockies.</B> Owning Tulowitzki before the All-Star break was a disaster (.166-3-16), but fantasy owners who picked him up off waivers enjoyed a better second half (.327-5-30). And remember, Tulowitzki is just 24. He should be accessible in the middle rounds on draft day.
<P><B>3 DOWN</B>
<P><B>1. Derek Jeter, Yankees.</B> The fantasy novice always drafts Jeter on name recognition. He hit at least .300 for the fourth straight season, but his numbers dropped in every 5x5 category. Jeter is still OK in the middle-infielder spot, but no longer a reliable No. 1 shortstop. 
<P><B>2. Khalil Greene, Cardinals.</B> Greene's nightmare season (.213-10-35) ended prematurely when he broke his hand punching a storage cabinet. A return to his '07 form (.254-27-97) seems unlikely, even in St. Louis.
<P><B>3. Miguel Tejada, Astros.</B> Tejada survived the Mitchell Report, but had his lowest home run total since 1998. He's on the downside of his career. 
<P><B>OK WITH JOSE?</B>
<P>Given Jimmy Rollins' slight dropoff, the first-round draft-day decision comes down to Hanley Ramirez vs. Jose Reyes. Which way do you go in a 5x5 league? What about a points league? 
<P>Let's take a look at their 5x5 totals first: 
<P><table>
<tr><td> <B>5X5</B> </td><td>  </td><td> <B>Ramirez</B> </td><td> <B>Reyes</B> </td></tr>
<tr><td> Average </td><td>  </td><td> .301 </td><td> .297 </td></tr>
<tr><td> Home Runs </td><td>  </td><td> 33 </td><td> 16 </td></tr>
<tr><td> RBIs </td><td>  </td><td> 67 </td><td> 68 </td></tr>
<tr><td> Runs </td><td>  </td><td> 125 </td><td> 113 </td><td>  </td><td>   </td></tr>
<tr><td> Stolen Bases </td><td>  </td><td> 35 </td><td> 56 </td></tr>
</table>	 
<P><B>Analysis:</B> Ramirez has better totals in three of the five categories, but Reyes is closer than you think. It depends on which direction you want to take. Like power? Go with Ramirez. Want steals? Reyes is your guy. When you take everything into account (including room to improve), the decision is a little easier.<br />
<P><B>The Pick:</B> Ramirez
<P>With points leagues, on top of the standard 5x5 categories, let's take a look at the rest of the key statistics: 
<P><table>
<tr><td> <B>Points</B> </td><td>  </td><td> <B>Ramirez</B> </td><td> <B>Reyes</B> </td></tr>
<tr><td> Singles </td><td>  </td><td> 106 </td><td> 132 </td></tr>
<tr><td> Doubles </td><td>  </td><td> 34 </td><td> 37 </td><td>  </td><td>   </td></tr>
<tr><td> Triples </td><td>  </td><td> 4 </td><td> 19 </td></tr>
<tr><td> Walks </td><td>  </td><td> 92 </td><td> 66 </td></tr>
<tr><td> Ks </td><td>  </td><td> 122 </td><td> 82 </td></tr>
<tr><td> Home Runs </td><td>  </td><td> 33 </td><td> 16 </td><td>  </td><td>   </td></tr>
<tr><td> Total Bases </td><td>  </td><td> 318 </td><td> 327 </td></tr>
<tr><td> OBP </td><td>  </td><td> .400 </td><td> .358 </td></tr>
</table>	
<P><B>Analysis:</B> Ramirez's lead in home runs and on-base percentage isn't enough to compensate for Reyes' lead in the rest of the non-5x5 categories. That holds true when you factor in their comparable totals in runs, RBIs and average. Ramirez walks more, but he strikes out more, too. Double-check the setup of your league first, but the choice is somewhat surprising.<br />
<P><B>The Pick:</B> Reyes
<P><B>PROSPECTS</B>
<P><B>Ivan DeJesus Jr., Dodgers.</B> The son of a former big leaguer, DeJesus Jr. hit .324 with seven homers, 58 RBIs and 16 stolen bases at Double-A Jacksonville last year. The Dodgers will give him a shot if Rafael Furcal leaves. DeJesus shouldn't be messed with in April, but look for him to emerge in the second half. 
<P><B>Alcides Escobar, Brewers.</B> He hit .328 with eight homers, 76 RBIs and 34 stolen bases at Double-A Huntsville in 2008. The Brewers can't keep him down forever, and soon they'll have to make a decision between Escobar and J.J. Hardy. Monitor that situation all season.
<P><B>BUYER BEWARE</B>
<P><B>Ryan Theriot, Cubs.</B> Theriot hit .307 with 85 runs and 22 stolen bases in 2008, but he has little to offer in other categories (one HR, 38 RBIs). Remember, Theriot hit just .266 two years ago. The other shoe could fall in '09.
<P><B>Stephen Drew, Diamondbacks.</b> Drew had a career year (.291-21-67), but let's see him do it again. He burned fantasy owners in '07 (.238-12-60). He's still worth the investment; just make sure you have insurance.
<P><B>Edgar Renteria, Giants.</B> When will Renteria learn that the A.L. isn't the place for him? He hit just .270 with 10 homers and 55 RBIs last year, prompting the Tigers to let him go in the offseason. He should bounce back with the Giants, but don't bid too high.
<P><B>THE SPECIALISTS</B>
<P>Looking for a backup shortstop to help your team? Sometimes it's best to grab a one-category specialist: 
<P><B>Average: Cristian Guzman, Nationals.</B> Few baseball-related matters get noticed in our nation's capital. Guzman's .316 average in last year merits a second look.
<P><B>Home Runs: Ben Zobrist, Rays.</B> Hit 12 homers in just 62 games, but a weak postseason showing could cut even further into his limited playing time.
<P><B>RBIs: Bobby Crosby, Athletics.</B> Few owners would've ever guessed Crosby finished fourth among A.L. shortstops in RBIs (61). Just don't count on Crosby to stay healthy.
<P><B>Runs: Yunel Escobar, Braves.</B> Scored 71 runs for an offensively-challenged team. Escobar also hit .317 as a leadoff hitter last season, and he's only going to get better.
<P><B>Stolen Bases: Cesar Izturis, Orioles.</B> After the "Three R's," Izturis had the next-best stolen base total (24).
<P><B>AUCTION STRATEGY</B>
<P>Jimmy Rollins' down year was a blessing in disguise. Now auction leaguers can get a top-three shortstop on the cheap. Owners know all about Rollins' so-so 2008 statistics (.277-11-59), and will avoid him as a result. 
<P>A few things to consider: Rollins still ranked second among shortstops in steals (47). Also, he's hitting leadoff in a lineup that features Chase Utley and Ryan Howard. 
<P>The bidding wars for Hanley Ramirez and Jose Reyes will get out of control. Make a strong play for Rollins instead.
<P><B>AVERAGE JOES</B>
<P> <table cellpadding=3 cellspacing=1 border=0 width=100% bgcolor=CCCCCC class=v11>
<tr bgcolor="#000000" style="color: #FFFFFF;"><td align=left> <B> POSITION </td><td align=left> <B> AVERAGE </td><td align=left> <B> RUNS </td><td align=left> <B> HRs </td><td align=left> <B> RBIs </td><td align=left> <B> SBs </td> </tr>
<tr bgcolor="FFFFFF" valign=top><td align=left> SS </td><td align=left> .284 </td><td align=left> 78 </td><td align=left> 11 </td><td align=left> 57 </td><td align=left> 14 </td></tr>
</table>
<font class=text>
<P><B>Orlando Cabrera, White Sox.</B> Cabrera's 2008 stats resemble the average production for mixed-league second basemen. His average went up after the All-Star break (.298), but he had 15 of his 19 steals in the first half of the season. Don't reach too much below Cabrera for a No. 1 shortstop.
