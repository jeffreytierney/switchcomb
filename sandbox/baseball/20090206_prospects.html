<p>
<font class=text><p>In the famous words of Forrest Gump, prospect rankings are like a box of chocolates -- you never know what you're going to get. Actually, he may have been referring to life, but the analogy fits. 
<p>Prospects are unproven, and projecting their major league impact is an uncertain task. However, in evaluating potential, two factors need to be considered -- talent and opportunity. Without talent, opportunity can be wasted and vice versa. 
<p>Thus, the following list is not an attempt to project the most talented prospects in the majors, but rather who of those will receive an opportunity in 2009. Observations and interviews with many of these prospects have been taken into account, as well as Sabermetric statistical analysis. 
<p>Nevertheless, however foresighted we may be, each season produces surprises as trades, injuries and other factors create opportunities for emerging stars. For those fantasy owners smart enough to do their homework, prospects can be an important part of a winning formula.  
<p>So, dig in. They may not be chocolates, but getting an edge on your fellow owners and using this year's crop of impact prospects to put your fantasy team over the top will be just as sweet.
<p><i>Note: For the purpose of compiling the list, prospects were defined as those players with less than 150 at-bats or 50 innings pitched in the major leagues.</i>
<p><b>Top 50 for 2009</b>
<p><b> 1. David Price, SP/RP, Tampa Bay</b>. Price showed his prowess as a late-inning reliever in the 2008 postseason, but he'll likely be slotted into the Rays' starting rotation this year. A high-90s fastball and nasty slider helped Price dominate hitters in short relief last season. As a starter, he'll need to use his changeup more, but he has the poise and maturity to succeed over a full season. 
<p><b>2. Max Scherzer, SP, Arizona</b>. Scherzer had success in limited duty last season, but 2009 will be his year to shine as he steps into the Diamondbacks' rotation full time. Scherzer has great stuff, highlighted by a mid-90s fastball, a good slider and an effective changeup, but it's his intelligence that sets him apart as a pitcher. He's a smart, analytical hurler who knows how to set up hitters and put them away. 
<p><b>3. Matt Wieters, C, Baltimore</b>. While Wieters only made it as high as Double-A in 2008, expect him to be the Orioles' starting backstop sometime this season. The switch-hitting rookie has great hands and bat speed, and the only thing slowing him down is his defense. Wieters' footwork is sloppy and his ability to manage a big league staff is unproven. Nevertheless, once he gets his shot, expect numbers on par with Minnesota catcher Joe Mauer, but with more power.
<p><b>4. Travis Snider, OF, Toronto</b>. Snider hit .301 in a late-season call-up and has a strong chance for a starting outfield spot in 2009. His power potential is tremendous, along with excellent mechanics and bat control. He uses the whole field and should hit for a decent average, although he doesn't have a consistent approach and will likely strike out in large numbers. 
<p><b>5. Matt LaPorta, OF, Cleveland</b>. LaPorta's bat is major-league ready and the Tribe is thin in the outfield. The big right-hander gets excellent extension on his swing, allowing him to generate plus power to all fields. He also has good plate discipline for a young hitter and should be able to maintain a decent average as a big leaguer. 
<p><b>6. Pablo Sandoval, 1B/C, San Francisco</b>. Sandoval flew under the radar in 2008. He started the year in high Class A, but a late-season call-up in which Sandoval hit .345 has thrown him into the big-league mix for '09. While he's an above-average defender behind the dish, Sandoval may see more time at first base as the Giants work to get his bat in the lineup on a daily basis. 
<p><b>7. Colby Rasmus, OF, St. Louis</b>. Although his ability is unquestioned, Rasmus has been slowed by injuries and inconsistency. If he can stay healthy, Rasmus should either win a starting outfield job in spring training or get an early-season call-up. When Rasmus is locked in, he's a deadly pull hitter and an aggressive base runner with 20-20 potential. 
<p><b>8. Daniel Murphy, 2B/OF, New York Mets</b>. Murphy performed well in left field during a late-season call-up, but second base may be a better fit for the Mets' needs. After hitting .313 in his short big-league stint, Murphy was one of the stars of the Arizona Fall League, where he showed great plate discipline and an above average glove at second. Murphy doesn't have much power, but he has a great approach, superb pitch recognition and tremendous bat control. 
<p><b>9. Taylor Teagarden, C, Texas</b>. Teagarden won't slug .829 like he did for Texas this past September, but he has a strong chance to be the Rangers' starting catcher this year. Teagarden is also advanced defensively, with an above-average arm and a quick release. At the plate, Teagarden is learning to drive the ball but has the potential to hit 20 or more home runs.
<p><b>10. Cameron Maybin, OF, Florida</b>. The trade of Josh Willingham to the Nationals opens the way for Maybin to play every day this year. Despite his talent, the Marlins rookie has a penchant for getting himself out swinging at marginal strikes. However, Maybin showed better strike zone discipline in a September call-up when he hit .500 in 32 at-bats, and can be counted on to get plenty of chances to learn in Florida. 
<p><b>11. Jeff Samardzija, RP, Chicago Cubs</b>. Samardzija's role for 2009 is uncertain, but what is clear is the former Notre Dame football standout's big league arm. A starter in the minors, Samardzija could compete for a job in the starting rotation or eventually work his way into the closer's role given the Cubs' unsettled bullpen situation. Either way, he'll need better command to realize his potential. He'll be a No. 5 starter if he makes the rotation.
<p><b>12. Gaby Sanchez, 1B, Florida</b>. The trade of Mike Jacobs opens the way for Sanchez to possibly start at first base for the Marlins this year. While Sanchez is still learning to drive the ball, he has the mechanics and strength to hit for at least average power. He's already a polished hitter with a good idea of the strike zone and an ability to use the entire field. 
<p><b>13. Chris Dickerson, OF, Cincinnati</b>. Dickerson's plate discipline improved in 2008 and his production increased accordingly. He'll never hit .300 over a full season but has enough leverage in his swing to drive balls to the gaps and hit 15 to 20 home runs, as well as steal 30 bases a year. Nevertheless, Dickerson has shown enough to be the leading candidate to start in left field for the Reds.
<p><b>14. Trevor Cahill, SP, Oakland</b>. The Athletics' rotation is once again wide open and Cahill is a prime candidate for a slot. While Cahill looks younger than his 20 years of age, he's a mature, cerebral pitcher. He won't dominate in the bigs, but can be an effective groundball pitcher by locating down and mixing his pitches.
<p><b>15. Josh Anderson, OF, Atlanta</b>. Anderson's late-season call-up, in which he hit .294, cemented his spot in the Braves' starting lineup for 2009. While he has little power, Anderson makes consistent contact and uses his speed to leg out base hits. Anderson's fantasy value, however, lies in his legs. He was one of the best base thieves in the minors and carried that success to Atlanta, where he stole 10 bags in 11 attempts.
<p><b>16. Brett Gardner, OF, New York Yankees</b>. While the Yankees can be counted on to play the free-agent market, Gardner is the best option to fill the center field opening. After a slow start during an earlier call-up, Gardner hit .283 in September. He also swiped 13 bases in 14 attempts for the season. Gardner won't hit for power, but will get on base, score runs and steal a pile of bags. 
<p><b>17. Tommy Hanson, SP, Atlanta</b>. Hanson was one of the most effective pitchers in the minors last season and is likely to get a look in the Braves' rotation this year. He looked sharp in the Arizona Fall League and his ability to mix pitches improved. With a plus breaking ball and deceptive fastball, Hanson appears ready to take on major league hitters after striking out 163 batters in 138 minor league innings last year. 
<p><b>18. Mat Gamel, 3B, Milwaukee</b>. Even if Bill Hall revives his career, Gamel will challenge him for the starting third baseman spot this year. The talented lefty uses the whole field, has good plate discipline and makes consistent contact. He doesn't have the bat speed and leverage to be a power threat, but has good enough mechanics to hit for a high average in the majors. 
<p><b>19. Will Venable, OF, San Diego</b>. As the team dumps payroll, Venable will have a chance to start in a depleted Padres outfield. Venable has good hands and plus bat speed, but his skills are average. He may develop more power as he learns to create added leverage in his swing, with an upside of 20 to 25 home runs.
<p><b>20. David Huff, SP, Cleveland</b>. Huff has a full arsenal of pitches, including an effective changeup and a good sinker, which he used effectively in 2008. Huff's velocity is average and he'll need to be crafty and precise to have sustained success, but he could eventually fill the back end of the Tribe's rotation.
<p><b>21. Lou Marson, C, Philadelphia</b>. Marson may not open the season as the Phillies' everyday catcher, but he's likely to end up with the job before 2009 is over. He has a short swing, good plate discipline and consistent mechanics. Marson doesn't try to do too much with the ball, which limits his power but enhances his consistency. 
<p><b>22. Chris Perez, RP, St. Louis</b>. Perez had a rough ride as the Cardinals' closer in September and isn't guaranteed the job in spring training. Still, he has the experience and mentality to be a ninth-inning guy who will get his shot this season. Perez has a classic power fastball/slider combo and can reach the upper 90s with his heater. He has had command problems, but when he locates down in the strike zone, Perez can be tough to hit. Unless the Cardinals land a free-agent closer, Perez will get first crack at the job. 
<p><b>23. Joey Devine, RP, Oakland</b>. Devine put it all together last year, holding major league hitters to a .150 average in 45.2 innings of work. The key to Devine's success was greater consistency in locating his fastball, which can reach the high 90s. Although Brad Ziegler claimed the Athletics' ninth-inning duties in the second half of 2008, don't assume the job is locked up. Devine is better than Ziegler and could close for Oakland for part or all of '09.
<p><b>24. Andrew McCutchen, OF, Pittsburgh</b>. The Pirates' coaches gush over McCutchen's work ethic and tools but have yet to give him a big-league call-up. Having proven himself at Triple-A and with an unsettled outfield situation in Pittsburgh, McCutchen is poised to get his break this season.
<p><b>25. Brett Anderson, SP, Oakland</b>. Anderson, like Trevor Cahill, is in the mix for a rotation spot in Oakland this season, although he's a step behind his fellow rookie teammate. Anderson has a polished delivery and outstanding command. He'll get a shot at some point this year and should put up numbers worthy of a No. 5 starter. 
<p><b>26. Angel Salome, C, Milwaukee</b>. It's a matter of time before the powerful Salome supplants Jason Kendall as the Brewers' backstop. His defense will be the determining factor in when he gets a chance but a good performance at the plate will force the issue.
<p><b>27. Brett Cecil, SP, Toronto</b>. With plenty of holes in the Blue Jays' 2009 rotation, Cecil may get a chance to step into a big league role. Don't expect ace production, but he could win 10-12 games and put up good strikeout numbers if he lands a starting spot in spring training.
<p><b>28. Jason Motte, RP, St. Louis</b>. Motte will start the year in a setup role but could close in 2009 given the Cardinals' uncertain bullpen situation. A converted catcher who's still learning how to pitch, Motte relied on an explosive high-90s heater to strike out 110 batters in 66.2 Triple-A innings last season. He also notched 16 strikeouts in 11 September innings with the Cardinals.
<p><b>29. Luis Montanez, OF, Baltimore</b>. Montanez is not a long-term solution for the Orioles' outfield, but he's a candidate to play left field this season. Montanez showed good power and improved discipline last season. However, his approach is still inconsistent, and his ability to make adjustments is unproven. 
<p><b>30. Jess Todd, SP, St. Louis</b>. The Cardinals have serious questions in their starting rotation for this season and Todd could be one of the answers. He's not a hard thrower but his delivery is deceptive and he keeps the ball down. Todd is the most advanced of the Cardinals' crop of pitching prospects and the most likely to win a starting job this spring.
<p><b>31. Steve Pearce, OF, Pittsburgh</B>. Pearce has great power potential because of excellent bat speed and good leverage in his swing. If he can develop more consistency, Pearce will be a power threat in the majors. Don't expect a high average but he'll hit more than his share of home runs.
<p><b>32. Clayton Richard, SP, Chicago White Sox</b>. Richard performed adequately in eight late-season starts with the White Sox last season and will be in the mix for a rotation spot this spring. He succeeds by keeping the ball down in the zone, inducing ground balls and limiting home runs. 
<p><b>33. Chris Tillman, SP, Baltimore</b>. While Tillman is more likely to make an impact in 2010, don't count him out this year. The big right-hander has a smooth delivery and a good low-90s fastball. He'll have to locate better to handle major league hitters, but has the makings of a middle-of-the-rotation starter.  
<p><b>34. Alcides Escobar, SS, Milwaukee</b>. Escobar's rapid development could force the Brewers to open a spot for him in 2009. Despite being a free swinger at the plate, Escobar is a good defender and has great speed. If Escobar performs well in the spring, the Brewers could eventually trade J.J. Hardy or move him to second base. 
<p><b>35. Michael Bowden, SP, Boston</b>. Bowden doesn't have a dedicated spot in Boston's rotation but expect him to get a chance. Last season, Bowden's improved fastball command meant he was able to use his secondary pitches more effectively. With a polished repertoire and a good defense behind him, he should be a serviceable fantasy option.
<p><b>36. Dexter Fowler, OF, Colorado</b>. Fowler has impressive tools, but don't be fooled by his minor league numbers (.335/.431/.515 at Double-A this year). Fowler's mechanics are awkward and experienced pitchers ate him up in the Olympics and during his September call-up. Fowler has 20-20 potential and he'll have a shot to win a big-league job this year, but it's unclear whether he'll be ready. 
<p><b>37. Carlos Carrasco, SP, Philadelphia</b>. Carrasco doesn't have a spot on the Phillies' roster yet, but with continued improvement in 2009, it'll be hard not to bring him into the rotation. The top Philadelphia prospect for several years, Carrasco is only 21 and is learning how to harness his ability.  
<p><b>38. Gio Gonzalez, SP, Oakland</b>. Gonzalez has the ability to pitch in the middle or front of a big-league rotation, but he may take another season to absorb the changes the Athletics made to his delivery. He could be the sleeper in the competition for spots in Oakland's rotation this year. 
<p><b>39. Aaron Poreda, SP, Chicago White Sox</b>. Poreda has more potential than fellow Sox prospect Clayton Richard, but he's behind Richard in the competition for a big-league job this season. With further development of his secondary pitches Poreda could get a midseason call-up. 
<p><b>40. Fernando Martinez, OF, New York Mets</b>. Martinez is a top talent but his impact in 2009 is hard to gauge. Despite plus bat speed and great hands, he has been plagued by injuries and inconsistency. If Martinez can stay healthy, he could realize his potential and eventually win a big-league job.  
<p><b>41. Will Inman, SP, San Diego</b>. Although Inman isn't the leading candidate to be in the Padres' rotation this season, he has better long-term potential than the other prospects competing for a slot. He's a serviceable back-of-the-rotation starter who should get a chance in spring training.
<p><b>42. Jake Arrieta, SP, Baltimore</b>. If this were a 2010 list, Arrieta would be 20 slots higher. As it is, his role this season will be limited at best. Still, he's a top talent and could force the Orioles to give him a shot in the second half of the season. Arrieta still relies too much on his explosive fastball, but there's no doubt he has the makings of a future No. 2 or No. 3 starter.  
<p><b>43. Jonathon Niese, SP, New York Mets</b>. The Mets' rotation could have at least one open slot and Niese is the best internal candidate for the job. While he's not overpowering, Niese has three effective pitches and is learning how to mix his offerings and set up hitters.
<p><b>44. J.P. Arencibia, C, Toronto</b>. Although he's not better than third on the Toronto depth chart at catcher, Arencibia could end 2009 as the Blue Jays' starting backstop. While he made strides at the plate in '08, Arencibia still doesn't have great strike zone discipline. The more he can improve his discipline, the greater his chances of receiving a mid-season call-up.
<p><b>45. James McDonald, SP, Los Angeles Dodgers</b>. While it's uncertain whether he'll get a chance to compete for a spot in spring training, McDonald is sure to start for Los Angeles at some point in the future. The slender right-hander has a plus curveball, a good fastball and an effective changeup. Ultimately, he profiles as a middle-of-the-rotation starter.
<p><b>46. Jordan Zimmerman, SP, Washington</b>. Zimmerman has flown under the radar since being drafted out of Division III Wisconsin-Stevens Point in 2007. That could change this year, however. While the Nationals have an abundance of competitors for their starting slots, Zimmerman is the most talented arm in their farm system. 
<p><b>47. Homer Bailey, SP, Cincinnati</b>. He had an awful 2008 campaign that saw an erosion of his command. However, Bailey has talent and could have an impact on a big-league level. If he's throwing strikes and hitting the mid-90s on the radar gun, put him back on your watch list.
<p><b>48. Fernando Perez, OF, Tampa Bay</b>.  After a decent Triple-A campaign, Perez hit just three home runs and stole five bases in 60 September at-bats with Tampa Bay. However, the switch-hitting speedster may have played his way into the Rays' outfield mix this year.
<p><b>49. Wes Hodges, 3B, Cleveland</b>. The Indians' third base job will be up for grabs at some point during the season and Hodges is the most likely beneficiary. While he doesn't have any outstanding tools and is an average defender, Hodges is a solid hitter.  
<p><b>50. Mitchell Boggs, SP, St. Louis</b>. Boggs got a late-season audition in St. Louis last year and, along with Jess Todd, will be in the mix for a rotation spot in 2009. Boggs has average command but is consistent and uses his slider effectively. He'll need to be more precise in his location to succeed on a big-league level, however.
