<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Nationals.</i>
<p><b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/nationals/index.html>Nationals team page</a></b><br/>

<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>Until recently, the Nationals' offseason resembled my high school romantic career: a lot of talk with not much action to speak of. Linked in rumors to free-agent targets (Mark Teixeira, Milton Bradley, Orlando Hudson) and trade-bait, the Nats lone splash was dealing for Scott Olsen and Josh Willingham, but that all changed when they signed slugger Adam Dunn. By adding Dunn and Willingham to an OF/1B mix that already included Lastings Milledge, Elijah Dukes, Austin Kearns, Wily Mo Pena, Corey Patterson, Willie Harris, Nick Johnson, and Dmitri Young, the Nats find themselves with an embarrassment of riches (relatively speaking). 
<P>The pitching staff, meanwhile, is simply an embarrassment. Acquiring Scott Olsen from the Marlins gave the Nats their highest-ranked SP -- and he really shouldn't be drafted in most mixed leagues. With some time still left in the Hot Stove League, maybe GM Jim Bowden can flip his excess bats for some league-average pitching. 
<P>Although the Rays' 2008 Cinderella performance gave bad teams reason to dream, Nats fans should prepare for another nightmarish season.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>Can Adam Dunn continue his mash-tastic ways in Nationals Park?</b> 
<p>Short answer: Yes. While Dunn did compile a .254/.385/.556 line throughout his career at the Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati, he also has a .242/.373/.497 career road line (the resultant .870 OPS would have ranked 42nd overall last season). His splits are even closer from 2006-2008: .245/.376/.521 at home, .244/.381/.516 on the road. Bank on him for 30-35 homers with eligibility at 1B, OF and CI.
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> If we're being honest here, the only National who closely resembles this description is Dunn. Ryan Zimmerman has name recognition, but he's a mixed-league corner infielder at best until he proves otherwise. Cristian Guzman? Josh Willingham? These are not must-own guys. One more bit on Dunn: His 2008 BABIP (.262) was 28 points below his career average -- he could bounce back to hit around .250, which would make his power that much more valuable.
<br/><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> If you're drafting Cristian Guzman, you're doing so for his batting average (.316 in 2008, 10th-best in the majors). Don't forget, though, that batting averages can fluctuate more than other stats. Guzman's a career .270 hitter with some downright bad years thrown in. If he reverts back to his old ways, you've got yourself a whole lot of nothing.    
<br/><b>Others:</b> Nick Johnson, Austin Kearns.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Lastings Milledge has yet to live up to the hype he generated as a Mets prospect, but that doesn't mean he's a bust. A .268-14-61 line with 24 steals last season made him a top-50 outfielder, and he has a lot more development left in him. Snag him in the later rounds and watch his evolution continue.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Elijah Dukes.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> I like to call Lastings Milledge "Lastings Thrilledge." By the same logic, I could call Josh Willingham "Josh Thrillingham," except that he's not all that thrilling. He's just a solid outfielder who, last season excepted, is good for a decent average and 20-25 homers a year. He should get a boost from escaping Dolphin Stadium.

<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Pass. ... Sorry, I've always wanted to do that. The Nationals' rotation has more DND material than a sci-fi convention. Of course, they have a closer (Joel Hanrahan), so saves hounds will be interested in him at least. A simple rule of thumb: The fewer Nationals pitchers you draft, the better.
<br/><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Scott Olsen would appear to be the most fantasy-friendly pitcher on the Nats' staff, but consider that Olsen compiled a 4.09 career ERA in pitcher-friendly Dolphin Stadium vs. a 5.36 ERA on the road. He also struck out nearly two more batters per nine innings at home than on the road. Maybe his home-body ways will continue in Washington, but there are definite causes for concern (aside from his 4.65 career ERA).  
<br/><b>Others:</b> Just about any National standing on the mound. I'm exaggerating. A little.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> He probably won't start the season with the team, but top prospect Jordan Zimmermann is a guy to watch as the season goes on. Likely ticketed for Triple-A Syracuse, Zimmermann projects as a No. 3 starter with a mid-90s fastball and a good slider. It's not like the rotation will be that hard to crack. NL-only owners should be particularly interested in his progress.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> You know about Saul Rivera (maybe). Hardcore Nats fans know about Steven Shell (maybe). But how about Garrett Mock? Given three starts, the frustrating minor leaguer-turned-frustrating rookie logged a 7.20 ERA. After a well-advised move to the bullpen, he made 23 appearances, striking out 29 batters in 26 innings while putting together a tidy 2.42 ERA. NL-only owners could look to him for non-closer relief help if the Nats keep him in the bullpen.

<tr class="StandardTableEvenRow"><td> <b>Player</b> </td><td> <b>Proj. round</b> </td><td> <b>Comment</b> </td></tr>
<tr class="StandardTableOddRow"><td> <b>1.</b> John Lannan </td><td> DND </td><td> NL-only owners can look to him for ERA relief if better options are off the board. </td></tr>

<tr class="StandardTableEvenRow"><td> Saul Rivera, Setup </td><td> DND </td><td> Not even worth NL-only owners' time, really. </td></tr>

<font class=text>	
<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> In today's tough economic climate, you can't waste a dollar, let alone $900,000. So why pay $5.75M for Josh Willingham when breakout candidate Lastings Milledge is available at the low starting price of $4.85M? Milledge has a broader range of skills and is more likely to increase his "cool factor" than the rather boring Willingham (sorry, Josh).
<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> The great thing about points leagues is that they make you feel much better about owning Adam Dunn. I won't preach here about the importance of OBP, other than to say it's really important. Dunn walks like a champ and is a top-20 points league outfielder because of it.
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> I know how much time and effort goes into the dollar values we provide on this site, but that doesn't mean I agree with all of them. If I'm forced between paying $13 for Cristian Guzman or $12 for Derek Jeter or Stephen Drew, give me one of the cheaper (and better) guys. 
<p><b>Position Battle:</b> Even with the Nats seemingly out of the running for Orlando Hudson, it's not set in stone that Anderson Hernandez will start at second base. Ronnie Belliard will also get a look during spring training. The Belly would give NL-only owners an intriguing Swiss Army knife option, as he played more than 25 games each at first base, second base and third base, and he even saw limited action at shortstop. He's obviously most valuable at second base, but it's always good to have options.
<p><b>Ballpark factor:</b> Most stat-nerds will tell you that one season doesn't provide enough data to tell you how a given ballpark affects homers, batting average, etc. Let's give Nationals Park another couple seasons before we decide it's a hitters park or a pitchers park (it's probably most fair to say it's a visiting team's park -- rimshot, please!). Treat it as a non-factor until we get a better feel for it.
