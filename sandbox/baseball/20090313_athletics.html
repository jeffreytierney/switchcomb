<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the A's.</i>
<p><b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/athletics/index.html>A's team page</a></b><br/>
<b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/athletics/statistics/projections/>A's stat projections</a></b>
<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>It's not out of character for the A's to make splashy trades during the offseason, but they're usually not the ones <i>receiving</i> the superstar player. Such was the case in November when Oakland acquired OF Matt Holliday from Colorado for RP Huston Street, SP Greg Smith and OF Carlos Gonzalez. 
<p>Holliday, who is in the final year of his contract, might not stay around long, but his presence, along with the arrivals of Jason Giambi and Orlando Cabrera, should have an immediate impact on Oakland's lineup. The A's ranked last in the majors in batting average (.242), 25th in homers (125) and 27th in runs scored (646) last year. Holliday, Giambi and Cabrera combined to hit .285 with 65 HRs and 268 runs last season.
<p>Couple that with the (hopefully) healthy returns of Mark Ellis, Travis Buck and Eric Chavez, and the A's could have one of the most improved offenses in baseball.
<p>They will likely need to score a lot of runs to help their young pitching staff. Justin Duchscherer returns as the ace, but he's already battling a right elbow injury. The rest of the rotation has a lot of talent and potential, but fantasy owners shouldn't get too excited about any of them -- at least not until they see some results on the field.
<p>Oakland's bullpen is also full of quality arms, and AL-only leaguers shouldn't overlook this strong unit. Despite the departure of Street, Oakland has at least two players (Joey Devine and Brad Ziegler) ready to step into the closer's role and provide nice production for mixed-league owners.
<p>The trade for Holliday was just one sign that things will be different in Oakland this year. Fantasy owners should start taking notice.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>How will Matt Holliday fare away from Coors Field?</b>
<p>I've already <a href=http://www.sportingnews.com/blog/FantasySourceFastball/186075/>devoted</a> a lot of <a href=http://www.sportingnews.com/blog/FantasySourceFastball/183036/>words</a> to defending <i>Fantasy Source</i>'s <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/rankings/overall/>No. 4 overall ranking</a> of Holliday, so I'll keep this section relatively short.
<p>The move from one of baseball's best hitters parks to one of the worst certainly won't make Holliday any better, but this guy has proven that he's one of baseball's best offensive players. His road splits have steadily improved over the past couple seasons, and he's a 29-year-old in a contract year. In other words, Holliday has a lot going for him.
<p>Many owners are still worried Holliday's stats will see a dramatic drop, but here's something to keep in mind: Since 2000, there have been 10 30-HR seasons and 12 29-HR seasons by A's players. Yes, several of those players may have been on steroids at the time, but I'm not sure any of them (with the possible exception of Jason Giambi in his prime) were better offensive players than Holliday. Players <i>can</i> hit 30-plus homers while playing 81 home games at McAfee Coliseum -- just remember that.
<p><i>(For more in-depth analysis of Holliday's move -- including lots of stats --  click <a href=http://www.sportingnews.com/blog/FantasySourceFastball/186075/>here</a> or <a href=http://www.sportingnews.com/blog/FantasySourceFastball/183036/>here</a>.)</i>
<p><b>HITTERS</B> 
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Matt Holliday. "Players <i>can</i> hit 30-plus homers while playing 81 home games at McAfee Coliseum." You might remember that quote from about five seconds ago. Well, it probably doesn't apply to Holliday ... since the A's will likely trade him in July. Make no mistake, Holliday is seen as a bargaining chip to A's GM Billy Beane, and we all know he loves to deal. All the concerns about Holliday playing in Oakland (bad park, he won't get to steal, etc.) are probably overblown since he'll be moved to a contender at some point this season. Even if he's not, he can still produce at a 30-20 level while challenging for a batting crown.
<br /><b>Others:</b> Jack Cust, Jason Giambi.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Orlando Cabrera. It was too easy to say Eric Chavez here, so instead we're going with Cabrera. He has been fairly consistent over the past several seasons, but his age (34) is starting to become a concern. Cabrera's career splits at McAfee Coliseum are alarming, too -- .226/.265/.314 with one homer, eight RBIs and 20 runs in 137 at-bats. His spot in the batting order is also up in the air. The A's tend to favor high-OBP guys more than most teams, and Cabrera's career OBP (.322) indicates he might wind up in the eight or nine spot, which would limit his run-scoring potential. 
<br /><b>Others:</b> Eric Chavez.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Travis Buck. Shin splits, an inner-ear infection and poor play derailed Buck's '08 season, but he's currently penciled in as the A's starting right fielder and leadoff hitter. He doesn't offer much power, but Buck had a solid batting average and OBP in the minors and during his rookie season in '07. Hitting in front of mashers like Holliday, Giambi and Cust should provide plenty of run-scoring opportunities.
<br /><b>Others:</b> Kurt Suzuki.
<p><b>Going Deeper:</b> Daric Barton was a popular sleeper last season, and he responded by hitting .226 with nine HRs and 47 RBIs in 446 at-bats. The 23-year-old first baseman isn't high on anyone's draft list this year (especially while he's nursing a nagging quadriceps injury), but it's too early to completely give up on him. He's still young and he has talent, but Barton will need to prove himself all over again and hope for an injury (or two) to players ahead of him on the depth chart. Don't be surprised if he resurfaces this season, and don't be shocked if he has success.

<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Brad Ziegler. Ziegler set a record last season when he didn't allow an earned run in his first 39 major league innings. He finished the year as Oakland's closer, converting 11 of 13 save chances. It's a bit unreasonable to expect another 1.06 ERA, especially when you factor in his mediocre K-rate (30 Ks in 59.2 innings), but Ziegler's submarine delivery induces a lot of ground balls and limits runs against him. We currently have him slotted as Oakland's closer, and unless Joey Devine gets healthy and has a big spring (or Ziegler flops), it will likely stay that way when the year opens. Even as a middle reliever, Ziegler has value (1.16 WHIP), but as a closer, he's a solid RP2. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Joey Devine.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Justin Duchscherer. Duchscherer had been a middle reliever for four seasons prior to last year, but he didn't have any trouble moving to the rotation. In 22 starts, Duchscherer went 10-8 with a 2.54 ERA, 1.00 WHIP and 95 Ks in 141.2 innings. The problem (aside from his low K-rate), was he spent time on the DL for the third straight season. If it's not his twice-surgically repaired hip, it's his right elbow. He has yet to pitch this spring because of elbow pain, so owners should be careful not to overpay. Having a healthy Duchscherer will greatly help your ERA and WHIP, but having an injured Duchscherer won't help anything.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Dallas Braden, Sean Gallagher.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Dana Eveland. Before the All-Star break, Eveland was a 7-6 with a 3.49 ERA, 1.40 WHIP and 74 Ks in 113.1 innings. He must have hit the "rookie wall," though, as he was eventually demoted to Triple-A. But after returning from the minors, Eveland went 2-1 with a 2.84 ERA and 1.26 WHIP -- before getting blown up at Texas in his final start. The bottom line is that Eveland really only had six bad weeks in his first year as a full-time starter. If the 25-year-old lefty can put that behind him and improve, he'll be a solid AL-only leaguer with back-of-the-rotation potential in mixed leagues. His relatively low K-rate and high WHIP will keep him from being elite, but he was better last season than his final numbers indicate. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Jerry Blevins, Santiago Casilla, Russ Springer.
<p><b>Going Deeper:</b> Gio Gonzalez has been a top prospect in three organizations (White Sox, Phillies, A's) -- and he's not even 24 yet. The talented lefty got his first taste of big league experience last year with Oakland, and it did not go well (7.68 ERA, 1.68 WHIP). But Gonzalez has a decent chance of opening the season as Oakland's fifth starter, and his high K-rate (9.00 in the majors last year; 9.37 at Triple-A) indicates that he might be able to help AL-only leaguers in the near future. By no means is Gonzalez a finished product, but he's someone to watch.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> The odds of Eric Chavez staying healthy aren't good. Thus, you shouldn't invest too heavily in him ($4.5M) in our Ultimate Salary Cap game. However, his inevitable injury will create playing time for cheaper options like Bobby Crosby ($3.75M), Nomar Garciaparra ($2M) and Jack Hannahan ($2M). None of those guys is going to carry your team, but they could each have some nice hot streaks hitting in Oakland's revamped lineup. If you catch them at the right time and at the right price, you can pick up some cheap points.

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> Oakland features two players who are considerably more valuable in points leagues. Both Jack Cust and Jason Giambi, despite their high strikeout totals, benefit points leaguers thanks to their stellar OBPs and power production. Both had OBPs over 120 points higher than their batting averages last season, and both hit more than 30 HRs. Owners in standard leagues tend to avoid slow, low-average players, but points leaguers will get a lot of bang for their buck with these two.
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> No one knows what to do with Matt Holliday, so you might as well toss his name out early and gauge the reaction. Either a bidding war will break out and Holliday will get overvalued and you can avoid him, or everyone will shy away and you can get him for cheap. For a player with so much uncertainty, either outcome is desirable for your team.

<p><b>Position Battle:</b> The A's closer battle is one to watch this spring. Unlike most of these situations, the A's actually have two competent players -- Brad Ziegler and Joey Devine -- competing for the job. Right now, we think Ziegler has the edge thanks to his experience last year, but many feel Devine has more dominant stuff and is better suited for the role. Devine has had problems staying healthy, though, and he's already nursing a sore right elbow. Either way, both of these players should be drafted, and both could find themselves in the closer's role at some point. Devine's K/9 ratio (9.66) is significantly better than Ziegler's (4.53), which gives him more fantasy value if they split duties.  
<p><b>Prospect Watch:</b> Oakland has four players listed in our <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/rankings/prospects/>Top 50 Prospects</a> -- all of them pitchers. Aside from Devine and Gio Gonzalez, who already have major league experience, the A's also have righty Trevor Cahill and lefty Brett Anderson waiting in the wings. Neither have pitched above Double-A, but both are candidates to get called up this season. Owners should track both players' progress in the minors this year. Thanks to their high K-rates (both over 8.00 in Double-A in '08), they could have immediate fantasy impacts if they join the big club.
