<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>If you were busy clipping coupons and trimming your budget to scrape by in these tough economic times, you may have missed the Yankees spending close to half a billion dollars on free agents this offseason. 
<p>It began when the Bombers lured CC Sabathia to the Bronx with a seven-year, $161 million deal. Shortly thereafter, A.J. Burnett signed a five-year, $82.5 million deal with the team. And somehow the Yankees still had $180 million lying around to entice Mark Teixeira into an eight-year deal. 
<p>And those weren't the only additions the Yankees made. They also traded Wilson Betemit and two minor league pitchers for 1B/OF Nick Swisher. But that was before the Teixeira signing, and the Yankees reportedly have been entertaining the idea of trading Swisher, so he might open the season on another team. 
<p>In the meantime, the Yankees were content to let Jason Giambi, Bobby Abreu and Ivan Rodriguez walk in free agency as they shift to a more youthful lineup. But there are still plenty of familiar Yankees veterans wearing pinstripes this season.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>What can fantasy owners expect from Joba Chamberlain in '09?</b> 
<p>The most talked-about middle reliever in baseball is preparing to make a full transition into a starting role in '09, but fantasy owners need to be wary of two important things.
<p>First, Chamberlain's professional career high for innings pitched is 116. That means the Yankees aren't likely to let him get too close to 150 innings this season (if they adhere to the unwritten rule that young pitchers shouldn't endure more than a 30-inning increase). If that's the case, either Chamberlain will be on a short leash during his starts or he'll eventually spend time back in the bullpen to avoid a big jump in innings.
<p>Second, Chamberlain has had a history of shoulder problems dating back to his days at Nebraska, and an increase in workload as a starter is only going to put him more at risk of another injury. Remember, he missed most of August last season with shoulder stiffness after just two months as a starter and returned as a reliever to end the year. 
<p>Fantasy owners should weigh these factors against Chamberlain's considerable upside before deciding if it's worth reaching for him on draft day. 
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Alex Rodriguez. You can't talk about A-Rod's fantasy prospects without mentioning the report that he tested positive for anabolic steroids in '03. But we shouldn't jump to conclusions, either. Steroids or no, Rodriguez is still one of the best players in the game and we'll have to see a significant drop-off in his numbers before we say any of his past eye-popping stats were artificially inflated. Even with all the drama, you can still expect to pay top-dollar for A-Rod. 
<br /><b>Others:</b> Robinson Cano, Johnny Damon, Derek Jeter, Mark Teixeira
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Jorge Posada. The Yankees veteran, who underwent shoulder surgery late last July, is expected to be ready for spring training. But his fantasy stock had already been falling. Posada, 37, managed to play only 51 games last season and had just a .411 slugging percentage, his lowest since '99. Even if he's ready for opening day, he's a risky option because of his age and health issues. And do you really want to carry a backup catcher just in case?
<br /><b>Others:</b> Hideki Matsui, Xavier Nady.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Nick Swisher. Bounce-back candidate might be a more accurate description than sleeper for Swisher, but either way, fantasy owners could get good value after his disappointing '08 campaign with the White Sox. He'll never hit for a good average, but he has 30-homer power and could drive in 80-90 runs in a stacked Yankees lineup. But a trade out of New York is still a possibility.
<br /><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Going Deeper:</b> Brett Gardner. Gardner will have to compete with Melky Cabrera (and hold off Swisher) for the starting center field job. Gardner has great speed, as evidenced by his 13 steals in just 141 plate appearances last season. That should attract AL-only leaguers, but know that he won't provide any power and isn't likely to hit atop the order.

<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B> 
<p><b>Must Own:</b> CC Sabathia. After carrying the Brewers to the playoffs last season, Sabathia landed a mega deal with the Yankees. The hype, along with his dominant second-half performance in '08, could make Sabathia the No. 1 pitcher drafted in your league. But beware that CC typically struggles early in the season and that might not go over well with Yankees fans. He's a clear-cut fantasy ace, but don't let your expectations get too high. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Joba Chamberlain, Chien-Ming Wang.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Mariano Rivera. He's one of the best closers in history, but the 39-year-old is coming off shoulder surgery this offseason. The surgery combined with his advanced age make it very likely that this could be the year Rivera <i>finally</i> declines. However, his numbers don't support this theory, as Rivera has recorded at least 30 saves in each of the past six seasons and has blown more than four saves just once in that span. Also, his ERA climbed above 2.00 just once in the last six seasons. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> A.J. Burnett, Phil Hughes, Ian Kennedy.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Edwar Ramirez. With Rivera facing health concerns and Joba Chamberlain headed to the rotation, Ramirez becomes a dark horse for saves. If Rivera is forced to miss any time early or reinjures his shoulder, the Yankees will likely turn to Ramirez in the ninth inning -- that is if they decide against moving Chamberlain back to the 'pen. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Going Deeper:</b>. Andy Pettitte. Pettitte doesn't carry mixed-league appeal any more, but he still offers plenty for AL-only owners. He had at least 14 wins in each of the past four seasons and still sports a solid K/9 rate (7.0 in '08). Just don't expect any ERA/WHIP help from the lefthander.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> It's not easy to find value picks on a high-profile team like the Yankees, but Hideki Matsui ($4.25M) fits this profile coming off an injury-shortened '08 season. His value is down after missing an average of 66 games the past three seasons and having knee surgery last September. But you should know he averaged 24 HRs and 108 RBIs in his four healthy seasons. If 100 percent on opening day, Matsui makes a great value pick.

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> Xavier Nady might not be a popular pick in 5x5 leagues, but he has nice value in points leagues. Did you know that he accumulated the 15th-most total bases (283) among outfielders last season? He also hit 25 homers, drove in 97 runs, scored 76 times and posted an .867 OPS between Pittsburgh and New York. If he lands an everyday job, Nady will be a nice, mid-round grab in points leagues. 
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> Looking for a good way to drain some dollars from your competition? Nominate nothing but Yankees early and let the hype machine do its thing. After owners get done buying A-Rod, Teixeira, Sabathia, et. al., they won't have as many dollars to throw around for the rest of the draft. Of course, if you're targeting anyone in pinstripes, nominate him last.

<p><b>Position Battle:</b> It will be interesting to see how the Yankees' outfield shapes up this spring. We know Hideki Matsui will strictly DH, so that opens up left field for Johnny Damon, but the rest is up in the air. In center, Melky Cabrera and Brett Gardner will duke it out, but neither is likely to make an impact in mixed leagues. In right field, Xavier Nady and Nick Swisher will fight for time, but it's possible one could be traded. If both remain with the Yankees, Swisher has a shot at playing center field, meaning Cabrera and Gardner could both be left out in the cold. 
<p><b>Ballpark Factor:</b> The Yankees will christen a new ballpark this season, but don't expect to see much of an effect on hitting or pitching stats. The new Yankee Stadium is expected to play exactly like the old one because its dimensions are the same as the original park. That means the Bronx has another hitter-friendly stadium with a little favoritism for lefthanders.
