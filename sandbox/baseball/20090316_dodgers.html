<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Dodgers.</i>

<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>In one of the offseason's most under-reported stories, the Dodgers and slugging gentleman/scholar Manny Ramirez agreed to a two-year contract. 
<P>Connoisseurs of rhetorical techniques will recognize that sentence as textbook sarcasm. In fact, the Manny negotiations received a level of press coverage usually reserved for Hollywood scandals or Presidential faux pas. After four months of Boras being Boras, Manny ended up with a two-year, $45 million deal much like the one he rejected in November. 
<P>Ramirez wasn't the only case of addition by retention, however. The Dodgers also brought back Casey Blake and Rafael Furcal, the latter of which is probably still a sore subject with Braves fans after his alleged agreement with Atlanta went, "poof." Orlando Hudson was the only "outsider" offensive acquisition of any consequence (sorry, Mr. Ausmus), but homegrown ingredients such as Matt Kemp, Russell Martin, and James Loney made any other moves unnecessary. Of course, the addition of Randy Wolf to the rotation makes one wonder if Ned Colletti has any recollection at all of '07, but every team is allowed a mulligan.
<P>Of the players that left, only Derek Lowe counts as a "loss." Sure, they said goodbye to two future Hall of Famers (Greg Maddux and Jeff Kent), but neither played like Cooperstowners last season. Brad Penny? Andruw Jones? Chan Ho Park? Nomar Garciaparra? These aren't names whispered with reverence around Chavez Ravine. 
<P>With Manny back on board and a talented core of young players, the Dodgers are the odds-on favorite to take divisional honors once again. They might even be so good that Dodgers fans show up on time -- and stay for the whole game!

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>Was Manny's 2008 a sign of things to come or just a contract push?</b> 
<p>It's a truth generally accepted that players in contract years tend to give a little extra. While Red Sox fans might quibble with that, Dodgers fans certainly benefitted from Manny's walk-year push, as he batted .396-17-53 in 53 games. But what now? Fantasy owners must note that, while Manny ranked as a top-5 hitter last season, he didn't crack the top 30 in either of the two preceding seasons due to injuries and missed playing time. Let's face it: Manny's not getting any younger, and he doesn't have the option to DH in LA. While he technically has the choice of opting out after this season, I don't know that fantasy owners can count on a repeat of that contract-year effect. We have him ranked at No. 15 overall, but that's too high for an aging outfielder who won't deliver steals. Expect a stellar batting average from Man-Ram, but his counting stats could take a hit if age and injuries catch up to him. 
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Matt Kemp is going 40-40. At least, that's what Matt Kemp says. Good thing he's not a fantasy expert. While I'd bet you a Coke the hallowed 40-40 is out of Kemp's grasp (I'm thinking more like 20-30), the fact remains that Kemp is a dangerous power-speed threat who is still developing. With 38 doubles, five triples, 18 homers, and 35 steals last year, Kemp ranked as a top-20 outfielder in both Roto and points formats (with better selectivity at the plate and on the base-paths, he'd do even better for points-leaguers). Perhaps even more impressively, he has shown that he can mash in pitcher-friendly Dodger Stadium (.847 career OPS at home vs. .785 on the road). Unlike a certain dread-locked multi-millionaire, Kemp's career trajectory is on the way up -- and he's the top Dodger on my rankings. 
<br/><B>Others:</b>Manny Ramirez, Russell Martin.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Orlando Hudson tips the scales as our 12th-ranked second baseman. This despite playing 107 games last year  ... and only 139 the year before. In fact, Hudson has played more than 140 games in a season exactly once over the last five seasons (2006, 157 games played, .287-15-67 with nine steals). If Hudson's injury history isn't enough to scare you away, consider this: Hudson hit .294 over the last three seasons with Arizona. His home numbers: .314/.392/.508. His away numbers: .274/.339/.392. There's a world of difference between Chase Field and Chavez Ravine. Unless you're an NL-only owner, stay away from Hudson's rude awakening.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Rafael Furcal, Casey Blake.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> If you get a spare minute at work today, do a Baseball-Reference.com search for James Loney and check out his similar batters through age 24. I'll give you a hint: The list includes Carlos Lee, Jeff Bagwell, and Adrian Gonzalez. Those are three guys who know how to hit the long ball. Despite hitting just 13 homers last year, Loney is at an age where it is reasonable to expect him to add some power to his game (heck, even if he just bounced back halfway toward his '07 rates, he'd be doing OK). In 1,040 big-league at-bats, Loney has put together a .303/.353/.480 line. I expect something like that from him this season -- a .300 average with 20-plus homers and a handful of steals. He's a definite NL-only starter with mixed-league upside.
<br/><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Poor Juan Pierre. Saber-nerds hate him, and the Dodgers think so little of his skills that they'd rather pay him $10 million to sit on the bench than pencil him in the lineup. Luckily for NL-only owners, Pierre still has value as a fourth outfielder. Case in point: In '08, Pierre ranked 30th among NL outfielders in Roto value despite receiving just 375 at-bats. It's amazing what 40 steals can do. Pierre has demanded a trade, although it's hard to imagine another team making the Dodgers' mistake their own. Even if he remains a high-dollar bench piece, Pierre is sure to find enough playing time (a nagging Manny injury here, a Matt Kemp rest day there) to swipe a few dozen bases and hit for enough average to help single-leaguers.

<p><B>PITCHERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Two-hundred innings? Check. Two-hundred strikeouts? Check. ERA less than or equal to pi? Check. Any way you sliced it, Chad Billingsley stepped up as a fantasy ace in '08. Whether facing lefties or righties at home or on the road before or after the All-Star break, there was no split that Billingsley failed to nail. The only hitch is Billingsley broke his leg in November after slipping on a patch of ice, but all indications this spring are that he's good to go. Mixed-leaguers might hedge their bets by making him their No. 2 (or, perhaps more appropriately, their No. 1A), but AL-only owners are the only ones who shouldn't shell out for this stud.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Jonathan Broxton.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Splitting time between San Diego and Houston last season, Randy Wolf compiled a 4.30 ERA, 12 wins, and 7.7 strikeouts per nine innings. More than that, he started 33 games, pitching 190.1 innings -- more than he had pitched in '06 and '07 combined. Given his checkered past, it's hard to know which accomplishment to doubt more: his durability or his effectiveness (granted, he had a 4.74 ERA in San Diego, which he salvaged with a 3.57 ERA in 12 starts for Houston). NL-only owners might be forgiven for giving Wolf a shot as their No. 4, but mixed-leaguers should continue to view Wolf with a mix of caution and indifference.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Jason Schmidt.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> With a single-digit wins total, an uninspiring strikeout rate, and the threat of a looming "sophomore slump," Hiroki Kuroda is a tough sell for mixed-leaguers. But keep in mind that his 3.73 ERA was actually <i>higher</i> than his FIP ERA of 3.59. With better run support (he ranked 81st among pitchers with at least 140 innings), the groundball-generating righty easily could have had 15 wins last season. Let Kuroda's innings-eating mentality work for you at the back of your mixed-league rotation. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Clayton Kershaw.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> In 2008, Hong-Chih Kuo's path became clear. After failed attempts as a starter, Kuo settled into a relief role, much to the dismay of opposing batters: He logged a 2.14 ERA with a 1.01 WHIP and 10.8 K/9. Possessing the endurance to go multiple innings and the skill to handle lefties and righties, Kuo is a non-closing reliever who will log enough innings, Ks, and vulture wins to help even mixed-league owners. That you can probably sneak him into your lineup as either an RP or an SP is a bonus.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> The key to an effective Ultimate Salary Cap player is upside. If you buy a player at, say, $5M, you must think that there's significant room for his value to grow to $6M or better. But I don't think that kind of optimism is warranted in the case of Manny Ramirez. It's not his fault -- the starting price is just too high. At $9M, Manny is the fourth-most expensive hitter on the board and, as I said earlier, I'm inclined to think '08 was a high-water mark rather than a harbinger of things to come. At $6.3M, Matt Kemp is far more likely to produce some profits for your club.

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> Remember what I said earlier about Juan Pierre having value even in a part-time role? Well, that doesn't exactly apply in points leagues. Pierre's steals aren't enough to prop up his value in a format that values the little things like "walks" and "extra-base hits." Fact is, even when Pierre got a full season's worth of time in '07, he only ranked as the 34th-best outfielder in points leagues despite ranking 17th in Roto value. 
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> In '08, Hong-Chih Kuo ranked 15th among relievers in Roto value thanks to his high-quality innings, strikeouts, and vulture wins. Some closers that he out-produced are going for three and four times as much as Kuo is priced at. When those high prices are flying for questionable commodities such as Brian Wilson or Huston Street, just repeat to yourself: "Saves aren't everything." For less than five bucks, you can grab yourself a solid No. 2 reliever.

<p><b>Doin' the Splits:</b> Since joining the Dodgers in 2006, Furcal has hit .318/.396/.478 at home and .269/.327/.365 on the road. ... Over the last three seasons, Casey Blake has hit .285/.365/.477 before the All-Star break and .262/.320/.431 after it. ... Russell Martin is a career .310/.427/.468 hitter in April -- and a career .260/.369/.386 hitter in September. ... In his rookie season, Clayton Kershaw logged a 3.41 ERA in  60.2 innings at home vs. a 5.36 ERA on the road. 
<p><b>Waiver-Wire Watch:</b> With Casey Blake and Orlando Hudson set to start at third and second, respectively, Blake DeWitt's playing time looks drier than a Stephen Wright punch-line (the kids still love Stephen Wright, right?). In fact, DeWitt's likely ticketed for Las Vegas to start the season. Still, NL-only owners will want to snap him up should anything untoward befall Blake or Hudson. Although he qualifies at third base, DeWitt will be most useful as an NL-only 2B or MI. He ranked 17th among NL second basemen in Roto value despite receiving only 368 at-bats, and he has proven useful as a band-aid if not a permanent solution.
