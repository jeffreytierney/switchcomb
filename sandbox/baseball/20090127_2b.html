<p><b><li><a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/rankings/2b/>Complete 2B rankings</a></b>
<P>Chase Utley is still the cream of the crop, but after Utley underwent hip surgery in late November, the door opened for the contenders to challenge his throne. The best-case scenario for Utley is that he's back within the first week of the season. However, it's possible he could be out until June.
<P>A combination of youth and power is adding a new dimension at second base in fantasy leagues. The days of a .290 average, 10 home runs and 20 steals being a second baseman's ceiling are almost gone, and players like Utley and Florida's Dan Uggla are proof. 
<P>Sure, there re a lot of speedy average hitters (i.e., Brian Roberts and Alexi Casilla) at second, but more guys playing the position are moving up in batting orders, driving in runs and crossing the plate. And it peaked with Boston's Dustin Pedroia winning the AL MVP. With the exception of Alfonso Soriano (now an outfielder), this was impossible a few years ago.
<P>Gone are the days where you wait until your roster is filled to snag a second baseman. Utley's still the best, but don't be discouraged if you aren't able to grab him. Players like Uggla, Pedroia, Texas' Ian Kinsler and Cincinnati's Brandon Phillips should all be productive despite not being first- or second-round fantasy picks.
<P>The parity at the position will only grow in 2009, and fantasy owners will take advantage. How nice would it be to have a second baseman that hits .300 with 25 homers? It's a possibility, and fantasy owners shouldn't overlook the depth here. Who knows? You might be passing on the Utley of the future.
<P><b>3 UP</b>
<P><b>Dustin Pedroia, Red Sox.</b> Pedroia is coming off an AL MVP season in which he hit 17 homers and stole 20 bases. And being in the Red Sox's lineup ensures a high run total, too.
<P><b>Jose Lopez, Mariners.</b> While stuck in the mess that is baseball in Seattle, Lopez quietly had a solid year (.297, 17 home runs, 89 RBIs). And at only 25, he should improve.
<P><b>Alexei Ramirez, White Sox.</b> If Ramirez can match his numbers from last year (.290, 21 home runs, 77 RBIs, 13 steals), he will be a solid early middle-round pick for any fantasy team.
<P><b>3 DOWN</b>
<P><b>Freddy Sanchez, Pirates.</b> After batting .304 with 11 home runs in 2007, Sanchez's stats declined across the board in '08. 
<P><b>Robinson Cano, Yankees.</b> Cano took a big step back last season, hitting just .271 with 14 home runs and 72 RBIs. He's no longer the "sure thing" everyone thought he was.
<P><b>Mark Ellis, Athletics.</b> Ellis had right-shoulder surgery last season, and his statistics declined drastically from 2007 when he was healthy.
<P><b>SLEEPERS</b>
<P>If you neglected to jump on the wealth of second-base depth early in your draft, have no fear -- there are plenty of young up-and-comers who could make waiting pay off.
<P>The Royals' Mike Aviles played more games at shortstop last year, but he'll have second-base eligibility. Alexi Casilla had more than 100 hits and 50 RBIs in just 98 games for the Twins. Emilio Bonifacio is a speedster who stole 123 bases in three minor league seasons. He could be a sleeper source for steals depending on how the Marlins use him.
<P><b>MR. CONSISTENCY</b>
<P>If you're not into taking risks, then Brian Roberts is your man. Since 2005, Roberts has been a .296 hitter, averaging more than 12 home runs and 60 RBIs per year during that span.
<P>With the exception of Utley, it's tough to find another second baseman who has been as consistent for as long as Roberts. Not only does he produce year after year, but Roberts also seems to improve with every season. He had a career year in 2005, so it wasn't surprising to see his numbers dip in '06. But since then, Roberts' hits have gone each year, as well as his extra-base hits, which are important in points leagues.
<P>Roberts will likely put up solid numbers this year, as Baltimore had one of the more explosive offenses in baseball last season. Even if Aubrey Huff and Melvin Mora regress, Roberts will continue to do his part for your fantasy team.
<P><b>POWER, SPEED, RESPECT</b>
<P>We already know Chase Utley and Dan Uggla can mash, as both hit more than 30 homers in 2008. But who else excelled in the power department last season? Mark DeRosa, Brandon Phillips and Alexei Ramirez all hit 21 homers, while the Rangers' Ian Kinsler chipped in 18 despite missing the final six weeks of the season because of a sports hernia. 
<P>Searching for some wheels? Look no further than Brian Roberts, who led all second basemen in steals in 2008 with 40. Kinsler (26) and Phillips (23) were next on the list. Kazuo Matsui (20) and Dustin Pedroia (20) each reached the 20-steals plateau, too.
<P>Utley, Kinsler, Pedroia, Phillips and Ramirez are potential 20-20 (or higher) guys who will provide more bang for the buck, but they will all be high draft picks (with the exception of Ramirez). Either way, they're worth it.
<P><b>MEDICAL REPORT</b>
<P>The injury bug nipped a few of the position's best last year, but none of the injuries is expected to carry over to the spring.
<P>Ian Kinsler missed the final six weeks of the season with a sports hernia. The injury doesn't typically cause any long-term repercussions, but keep it in mind when you're looking at his final stats from last year.
<P>Brandon Phillips missed the final three weeks of 2008 with a broken finger. However, the injury shouldn't be cause for concern in '09.
<P>The Angels' Howie Kendrick missed 24 of the last 30 games of the season with a strained hamstring, and he sat out for the Angels earlier in the year because of the same injury. Kendrick seems to be hurt on a yearly basis (he has never played more than 92 games in a season), so remember that before picking him.
<P>Orlando Hudson was lost for the final two months of the season with a dislocated left wrist. Hudson missed time in 2007 because of thumb surgery, so take note of the two hand injuries during the past two seasons. However, Hudson had had plenty of time to recover from the injury and should be ready for 2009.
<P><b>AUCTION STRATEGY</b>
<P>If you want Chase Utley, Ian Kinsler, Dustin Pedroia or Brandon Phillips, get ready to pay. The top four second basemen will require a lot of money in an auction draft. Is it worth it, though?
<p>In a word, "yes."
<P>Beyond the top four, there aren't a lot of "value" guys -- at least not ones you can count on. Brian Roberts and Dan Uggla are good, but they won't be too cheap.
<P>Perhaps the best values will be Alexei Ramirez and Robinson Cano. Ramirez is an up-and-coming star who could rival the top four when it's all said and done. And Cano will be a steal if he can bounce back to his 2006 and '07 form.
<P><b>AVERAGE JOES</b>

</table>
<font class=text>
<P><b>Kelly Johnson, Braves.</b> With the increasing depth among the elite players at second base, the "Average Joe" players are becoming less valuable in mixed leagues. However, there are still a few that are worthy of being drafted, like Johnson, who hit .287 with 12 home runs, 69 RBIs, 11 steals and 86 runs scored last year. It's possible to get some value out of these guys -- just don't reach too early.
