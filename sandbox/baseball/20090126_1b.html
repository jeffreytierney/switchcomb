<p><b><li><a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/rankings/1b/>Complete 1B rankings</a></b>
<P>We're right back where we started. Last year in this space we attempted to hand over Prince Albert's throne to one of the many challengers at a power-heavy position. But look who ended up back on top of the heap. 
<P>Albert Pujols shook off the doubters who were worried about a right elbow that, in his words, "could blow up at anytime." His numbers in 2008 were up compared with '07's in all five of the standard Rotisserie-league categories. 
<P>But a not-so-funny thing happened in the offseason: Pujols finally decided to have surgery on that elbow. And while it wasn't a Tommy John procedure as was first expected, surgery is surgery and it's sure to spook a few fantasy owners on draft day.
<P>But who are we to doubt this great slugger? Those who let him slip too far last year are probably still harboring regrets. It's difficult to imagine Pujols not hitting 30 homers, driving in 100 runs, and hitting well above .300 as he has in each of his first eight seasons in the majors.
<P>History is on Pujols' side, but you'll need to monitor his progress in spring training in order to determine whether he'll be worth the hefty price tag. As long as he doesn't experience a significant setback in his rehab, count on him to stay on top. 
<P><b>3 UP</b>
<P><b>1. Kevin Youkilis, Red Sox.</b> How's this for consistency? Youkilis had at least 15 runs and 15 RBIs during every month of last season. That's reliable production and makes Youkilis useful for owners in weekly head-to-head leagues.
<P><b>2. Joey Votto, Reds.</b> If you're looking for a player who could experience a nice carryover effect from the second half of 2008, Votto is your man. After the All-Star break, he hit .321 with a .959 OPS, 11 home runs and 44 RBIs in 60 games. With numbers like those, Votto didn't look like a rookie. 
<P><b>3. Chris Davis, Rangers.</b> Texas called up Davis in late June when an injured Hank Blalock couldn't make it back on time, and he Davis proceeded to hit his way into an extended stay. Once Blalock returned, the Rangers switched Davis from first base to third just to keep his powerful bat in the lineup, giving him useful position versatility.
<P><b>3 DOWN</b>
<P><b>1. Paul Konerko, White Sox.</b> Konerko's list of injuries included a sore toe, sore hand, oblique strain and knee sprain. Konerko turns 33 in March, and this could be the first sign his body is breaking down. Then again, he hit .331 with 13 home runs and 27 RBIs in August and September when he was healthier. Once a near-elite option at first base, Konerko now just adds power to your bench.
<P><b>2. Carlos Guillen, Tigers.</b> Guillen lost his shortstop eligibility by playing first and third base last season, and he is expected to start in left field this year. His stats matched up well to other shortstops, but they are pedestrian when compared with other corner infielders and outfielders. Plus, injuries again became a problem when Guillen missed most of the final two months with back pain.
<P><b>3. Todd Helton, Rockies.</b> Those expecting a rebound from Helton will be sorely disappointed. Helton had back surgery in the offseason, and could be used in a platoon with Jeff Baker. Helton still has the ability to hit for a high average, but as an older player with health problems, he's nothing more than a bench pick. 
<P><b>CAUTION! FALLING STATS AHEAD</b>
<P>Carlos Delgado, Aubrey Huff and Mike Jacobs were among those players in 2008 whose stats seemed too good to be true. Delgado bounced back from a disappointing '07 (24 home runs, 87 RBIs) to blast 38 homers with 115 RBIs last year. He even had a nine-RBI game in late June against the Yankees. But he'll be 36 on opening day, which means you could end up overpaying. 
<P>Huff had a season the likes of which he hadn't experienced since his breakout 2003 campaign with Tampa Bay. In 2006 and '07, fantasy owners were duped into thinking he could repeat such a season, only to be disappointed. Then, he Huff had a rebirth last year in Baltimore. Maybe he won't slip back into mediocrity, but to expect another performance like last year is a reach.
<P>Jacobs had career highs in games (141), home runs (32), RBIs (93) and runs (67) in last year. But his low batting average and on-base percentage make him a boom-or-bust fantasy player. Plus, a trade from Florida to Kansas City is another indication he likely won't repeat his '08 production. 
<P><b>SLEEPERS</b>
<P>We've seen only a small sample size from San Francisco's Pablo Sandoval, but it was encouraging. He's an aggressive hitter and will probably strike out a lot, but he could hit around .275 with 15-to-20 homers. 
<P>After being traded to the Yankees, Nick Swisher is an intriguing buy-low option in fantasy leagues. He's just 28 and a prime candidate for a bounce-back year. He'll enjoy taking shots at the short porch in right field in the new Yankee Stadium. 
<P><b>MR. SECOND HALF</b>
<P>It happens every May -- an e-mail will hit our inboxes with the subject line: "Give up on Teixeira yet?"
<P>That's because over the past three seasons, Mark Teixeira has been a notoriously slow starter. During that three-year span he has hit an average of three homers with 12 RBIs in April.
<P>But don't worry, Teixeira always wakes up. Check out what he has done in August and September. How does an average of eight homers with 24 RBIs in each of those months sound? Teixeira has made a living for fantasy owners with his strong finishes, and while these splits make it tough on weekly head-to-head leaguers, the rest of us need to practice patience with Big Tex.
<P><b>AUCTION STRATEGY</b>
<P>First base is not the place to go cheap. There are more 30-homer and 100-RBI players here than at any other position. Getting a big bopper who can provide consistent production will give you the ability to compete throughout the long fantasy season. 
<P>Plus, these guys have a good track record of staying in their lineups because playing the position isn't as rigorous as catcher, for example. 
<P>Those who don't want to get in a bidding war for the elite options can always go for second-tier guys such as Adrian Gonzalez and Kevin Youkilis.   
<P><b>AVERAGE JOE</b>

</table>
<font class=text>
<P><b>Adam LaRoche, Pirates.</b> His 2008 stats most closely resemble the average production for mixed-league first basemen. LaRoche hit .270 with 25 homers, 85 RBIs, 66 runs scored and one stolen base. Try to draft at least two first basemen ranked above LaRoche, and you'll be more than OK at the position.
