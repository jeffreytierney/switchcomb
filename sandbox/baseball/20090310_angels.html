<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Angels.</i>

<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>The declining real estate market wasn't the only thing to lose value in California this winter. 
<p>The Angels shed some payroll when they let Mark Teixeira and Francisco Rodriguez walk in free agency. Both players took massive production with them to their new haunts in New York. In their place, Los Angeles is hoping Kendry Morales and Brian Fuentes fit the bill.
<p>However, Angels owner Arte Moreno managed to take a little something back from New York by landing former Yankee Bobby Abreu to a one-year deal. Abreu fits nicely between Chone Figgins and Vladimir Guerrero in a lineup that lost some punch with the Teixeira defection but still might have enough pop to win the weak AL West.
<p>In addition to the big-name changes, the Angels also are dealing with a plethora of injuries in their pitching staff. With Ervin Santana (elbow sprain) expected to start the season on the DL and Kelvim Escobar (shoulder) not expected to return until May at the earliest, youngsters such as Nick Adenhart could get a chance to audition in April for bigger parts down the line.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>Is Vladimir Guerrero done as a fantasy stalwart?</b> 
<p>I've never actually owned Guerrero on one of my fantasy teams, but that doesn't mean I don't respect his game. And Guerrero has a tremendous amount of clout with my fantasy writing brethren. But it is time to face facts. Guerrero posted his lowest RBI and runs totals since 2003 (when he was limited to 112 games because of injury).
<p>Vlad no longer steals bases at the rate he once did. Plus, Guerrero will be without Teixeira in the lineup to help bolster his cause. But that doesn't mean all is lost. Guerrero is a virtual lock to hit .300 and can still bring solid numbers in homers, runs and RBIs. As long as you don't expect him to be the Vlad of yesteryear you'll be alright with him as your No. 2 outfielder.
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Bobby Abreu. It's not New York, but being in a lineup between Chone Figgins and Vladimir Guererro has its advantages. Plus, with an aggressive manager like Mike Scioscia expect Abreu to make another run at 20-plus steals. Although Abreu will turn 35 tomorrow, he's your best bet for finding elite production in Disneyland. Players like Abreu, who can fill up all five hitter categories in a Rotisserie league, are rare.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Vladimir Guerrero, Torii Hunter.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Chone Figgins. He's never been known for his power or RBI production, but last year saw significant decreases in both categories to the point where Figgins became another Ryan Theriot. In fact, that'd be an insult to Theriot based on last year's stats. Figgins still offers the uniqueness of getting steals from your third baseman, but those steals declined while he battled hamstring problems. Figgins is signed to a one-year deal, which could motivate him, or be an indication that he's no longer worth more to the Angels.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Juan Rivera.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Howie Kendrick. Last year, I said that if Marlins outfielder Jeremy Hermida failed to have a breakout season, I'd jump off his bandwagon. Hermida failed, so now I'm invoking "The Jeremy Hermida Rule" on Kendrick. Why bother with Kendrick? Because his main problem is injuries, not lack of talent. If Kendrick could just stay healthy, he could produce average, runs and steals at a weak position. He might even be a top-five second baseman who can be had much later.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Kendry Morales.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Brandon Wood. Here's another player fantasy pundits can't seem to give up on. And Wood's hot spring has rekindled hope he can finally turn things around. But unlike Kendrick, Wood hasn't been able to translate his talent into any measure of success on the big-league level. And even if he makes the Angels' roster, it will probably be as a reserve. There's the outside shot Wood could finally put it together and replace Figgins as early as next season, but AL-only owners in one-and-done leagues shouldn't buy in yet.

</table>
<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> John Lackey. In the last three seasons Lackey has averaged 15 wins with a 3.41 ERA and 1.23 WHIP. Despite such solid numbers, you'll find that nobody goes out of their way to draft him. That's because Lackey is coming off an injury-shortened season when he battled a triceps problem and saw his home-run rate increase. But provided he's healthy -- and all indications are he is -- he'll be a good grab once the elite pitchers are off the board. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Brian Fuentes.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Ervin Santana. He matched or set career bests in wins, innings, strikeouts, ERA, WHIP and K/9 ratio in '08. But if the career season wasn't enough to scare you about overpaying for Santana, his elbow problems this spring have probably sent you over the edge. A recent report revealed Santana has a sprained medial collateral ligament and is likely to start the season on the disabled list. Expect to see Santana's projected draft round drop when we do another all-encompassing update of the rankings next week.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Joe Saunders, Jered Weaver.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Kelvim Escobar. Plenty of owners might have forgotten about Escobar after he missed all of last season following shoulder surgery. We're not saying go out of your way to draft him, but Escobar does have quality experience -- like in 2007 when he won 18 games and was in the Cy Young conversation. Escobar isn't expected to return until May, and the injury-risk tag still applies. But he's someone to keep in mind for a sneaky play down the line. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Jose Arredondo.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Nick Adenhart. With Santana and Escobar hurt, Adenhart will battle Dustin Moseley and Shane Loux for a rotation spot out of spring training. <i>Baseball America</i> ranks Adenhart, 22, as the organization's top prospect, but AL-only owners might want to hold off on rejoicing should he emerge the winner. Adenhart's first stint in the majors was humbling (9.00 ERA, 2.58 WHIP in three starts), and his numbers weren't eye-popping last season at Triple-A, either (9-13, 5.76 ERA). But he has good stuff and is worth tracking.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> When you plunk down $4.75 million for Brian Fuentes in our Ultimate Fantasy Baseball game, you are essentially paying for potential, and that's not always a good thing. For example, Fuentes will cost the same as the Giants' Brian Wilson, even though Wilson outscored Fuentes by 126 SN points last year. If you believe Fuentes' numbers will improve that much going from the Rockies to the Angels, then his price will be worth it. But personally, if I'm going to gamble on a closer, I'd pay $3.7 million for Jonathan Broxton.

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> Chone Figgins' stolen bases have stronger appeal in 5x5 leagues than they do in most points leagues. According to our <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/statistics/sortableStatsShell.html?sortCategory=5X5&duration=365&year=2008&league=undefined&position=3B&page=1>Player Analyzer</a>, Figgins was the 20th most valuable third baseman in 5x5 leagues last season, but that ranking dropped to 27th in points leagues. The fact Figgins has no power (one home run last year) leads to fewer extra-base hits than you'd expect from your typical fantasy third baseman. You'd be better off drafting Mark Reynolds in most points-league setups.
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> We can think of worse ways to spend a buck in an auction league than using it to nab Kendry Morales. The Angels have decided to go with him at first base, finally giving the 25-year-old Cuban a chance at everyday at-bats. There's the potential for 20 homers with a .280 batting average here. That might not seem like much, but when you are scraping the bottom of your auction funds it suddenly becomes more appealing. Morales hit .341 with 15 homers and 64 RBIs in 78 games at Triple-A Salt Lake last season, and he has virtually no competition for the starting job.
<p><i>For the Angels' projected dollar values, <a href= http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/angels/dollarvalues/>click here.</a></i> 
<p><b>Position Battle:</b> The Angels have an interesting contrast at catcher. Jeff Mathis is a defense-first player while Mike Napoli is all about the power. Fantasy owners loved Napoli's 20 home runs in just 227 at-bats last season, but manager Mike Scioscia pointed out recently that Angels pitchers had an ERA that was a run lower when Mathis caught games for them. Because of this and the fact Napoli is trying to come back from shoulder surgery, Mathis will be in the picture. Napoli might see time at DH early in the season while he works his shoulder into shape.
<p><b>Ballpark Factor:</b> Angel Stadium has crept up into the neutral section in our <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/ballparks/index.html>Ballpark Rankings</a> during the past two seasons, but expect the sudden surge to end. Without Mark Teixeira, Los Angeles is lacking some punch in the middle of its lineup. Plus, Vladimir Guerrero is in decline. All of this could lead to a decrease in offense from the home team. Plus, with John Lackey and a solid bullpen in place the Angels are set up to win in a low-scoring fashion.
