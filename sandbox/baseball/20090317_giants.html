<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Giants.</i>

<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>The Giants are slowly weaning themselves off their reliance on older players. The farm system finally is stocked with prime talent, and some of the residual effects of the change in philosophy will dot the big-league roster as soon as this season.
<p>Twenty-two-year-old Pablo Sandoval will likely be the team's third baseman, and 25-year-old Travis Ishikawa will be at worst in a platoon at first base. Eugenio Velez and Emmanuel Burriss are the leading options at second base, and Fred Lewis adds some youth to the outfield.
<p>All of this combined with Tim Lincecum, Matt Cain and Jonathan Sanchez in the rotation gives the Giants a fresh look that they didn't have during the years when they plugged holes around Barry Bonds.
<p>Still, some of the Giants' old habits die hard. San Francisco's biggest offseason acquisition was 44-year-old lefthander Randy Johnson. If he stays healthy, the Big Unit will help the Giants improve on last season's 72-win output. If not, we'll see more youth come up from the minors in September.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>Do the Giants have enough hitting to back up the pitching?</b> 
<p>When the Giants made a brief play for Manny Ramirez, there was talk that this team could make a run for the division title. But ultimately Ramirez returned to the Dodgers, and the Giants were left with Bengie Molina as their cleanup hitter again.
<p>Although newly acquired Edgar Renteria will add more to the No. 2 spot in the lineup than Omar Vizquel could have, it's not enough for fantasy owners to get excited about this offense. In fact, it's still looking like a tough year of run support for Giants pitchers, and Matt Cain owners won't like to hear that.
<p>In 2008, San Francisco finished last in home runs and RBIs and was next-to-last in runs scored. There's nowhere to go but up from those numbers, but the Giants would need several of their young players to break out to make significant improvements. And that's unlikely.
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Bengie Molina. Moving to the cleanup spot last year agreed with Molina, who set a career high with 95 RBIs. Despite that lofty total, fantasy owners still won't view him as an elite fantasy catcher. That means you can sneak away with him in the middle rounds again. With Molina in a contract year, he should have plenty of incentive to back up last year's performance. Plus, he has youngsters Pablo Sandoval and Buster Posey nipping at his heels.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Pablo Sandoval.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Edgar Renteria. He has a history of posting better stats in the National League than the American League, which is why it might seem like a good idea that he went from Detroit to San Francisco. However, despite all of their struggles last year, the Tigers still outscored the Giants 821-640. While Renteria's batting average might be better with him back in the NL, his other key stats likely will continue to decline on a worse offensive team.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Aaron Rowand.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Fred Lewis. In his first full-time gig as a Giants outfielder, Lewis helped out 5x5 owners from a fringe role. His 21 steals and 81 runs and a .282 batting average weren't bad, though he missed September after having foot surgery. Look for continued improvement from the Giants' leadoff hitter. The key will be if he can start to hit lefthanded pitching better. That would help him avoid potential platoon situations and get more at-bats.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Randy Winn.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Travis Ishikawa rescued some of his lost prospect value last season when he hit .310 with 16 homers and 46 RBIs in 48 games at Triple-A. Then, the first baseman hit .274 with three homers and 15 RBIs in a brief stint with the Giants. Now that he has honed his hitting approach, NL-only leaguers can take a flier on him in the final rounds. It's possible Ishikawa could get the better half of a platoon with Rich Aurilia.

<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Tim Lincecum. Lincecum's 5-11, 170-pound frame and distinct delivery have earned him plenty of doubters over the years. But he is arguably the best pitcher in fantasy baseball. Lincecum led the majors in strikeouts with 265 in '08, and he was in the top five in wins and ERA. Some are concerned about his jump from 146.1 innings in '07 to 227 innings last season, and that's legitimate. There has been evidence of young pitchers getting hurt after such an increase. But the consistency of Lincecum's mechanics and demeanor could make him an exception.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Brian Wilson.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Barry Zito. The emergence of Lincecum and the signing of Randy Johnson take some pressure off Zito to live up to his fat contract. But until Zito recaptures a couple of miles per hour on his fastball, it's going to be tough for him to succeed, even though he still has a devastating curve. Fantasy owners should take the wait-and-see approach here. Zito improved after the All-Star break last season, but 6-5 with a 4.59 ERA and 1.46 WHIP was nothing to write home about.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Jonathan Sanchez. The first thing that stands out about Sanchez is his K/9 ratio. He averaged just a tad under a strikeout per inning last season. But he still needs to learn how to pitch, as evidenced by a 5.01 ERA and 1.45 WHIP last season. He alternated good and bad months all season. The next step for him is to develop consistency. But at 26 there's enough upside here to merit a late pick.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Matt Cain, Randy Johnson.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Madison Bumgarner. We might see Bumgarner by September, and if we do, he'll be another big lefty the Giants can throw into the rotation. At 6-4, 215 pounds, Bumgarner got off to a good start in his pro career by striking out 164 in 142 innings for low-A Augusta. Bumgarner is expected to team with top catcher prospect Buster Posey at Double-A for most of this season. Bumgarner is someone for keeper leaguers to watch.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> Pablo Sandoval has the potential to be one of the best bargains in our Ultimate Salary Cap Baseball game. Not only is he priced smartly at $3 million, but he also qualifies at multiple positions (1B/3B/C). Provided Sandoval can build on last season when he hit .345 in limited time (145 at-bats after being called up) he will be far better than similarly priced players Marco Scutaro and Aaron Miles. Sandoval is expected to start at third base.

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> Matt Cain has significantly more value in points leagues than 5x5 leagues because his lack of wins don't hurt your team as much. Cain's strong peripherals (ERA, WHIP, K/9) and ability to log high innings haven't translated into wins in the past two seasons because he has received some of the worst run support among starting pitchers. But in points leagues the run-support factor doesn't have as much effect. Check out this disparity: Cain ranks 31st in points-league production but just 49th in 5x5 leagues.
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> Cain is a potential bargain here, too, at $15, but Randy Johnson ($8) might be even better. According to our <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/analyzer/>Player Analyzer</a>, the Big Unit actually had more 5x5 value than Cain in 2008. And even at age 44 Johnson has practically the same strikeout potential as Cain. If Johnson can stay healthy -- granted that's a big "if" -- he could outperform Cain, and cost less.

<p><b>Position Battle:</b> The Giants brought back 37-year-old infielder Rich Aurilia, but he is likely just an insurance policy for Pablo Sandoval at third base and Travis Ishikawa at first. San Francisco might use Aurilia against lefthanded pitchers and Ishikawa (a lefthanded batter) against righties in a platoon at first. Or if Sandoval struggles with defense at third, Aurilia could see time there. It's something to keep in mind when evaluating Sandoval and Ishikawa.
<p><b>Prospect Watch:</B> The Giants have made an about-face in their farm system in recent years, and one of their rising talents is catcher Buster Posey. Although he is blocked by Bengie Molina this year, Posey is the Giants' catcher of the future. In '08, Posey won the Golden Spikes and Baseball America's College Player of the Year awards. At Florida State, he led NCAA Division I in hitting (.463), slugging percentage (.566), on-base percentage (.879), hits, total bases and RBIs. While Posey will likely catch in Double-A this year, Molina becomes a free agent after the '09 season, perhaps opening a spot.
