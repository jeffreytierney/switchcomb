<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Rangers.</i>
<p><b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/rangers/index.html>Rangers team page</a></b><br/>
<b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/rangers/statistics/projections/>Rangers stat projections</a></b>
<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>If you spent the winter hibernating, you've already accomplished more than Texas did this offseason. The Rangers' major acquisition was signing journeyman reliever Eddie Guardado, who they traded to Minnesota last August. Time will tell if that astute move will help improve the league's worst pitching staff. 
<p>To be fair, the Rangers did have a late deal in place with free agent Ben Sheets before it was revealed that he needed surgery to repair a torn flexor tendon in his pitching elbow. That offer was pulled, leaving the Rangers with the same pitiful rotation from a year ago. 
<p>That will put a lot of pressure on an offense that led the majors in runs, RBIs and slugging percentage a year ago. The good news is that only Milton Bradley and Gerald Laird are missing from that lineup. 
<p>Power-speed prospect Nelson Cruz figures to take over in right field, while Taylor Teagarden and Jarrod Saltalamacchia compete for time behind the plate. Another new face is prospect Elvis Andrus, whose speed and defensive talents have convinced the Rangers to move Michael Young from short to third to accommodate him. Until he gets a little more seasoning, free agent signee Omar Vizquel will keep the seat warm at shortstop. 
<p>To sum up: Fantasy owners can expect plenty of offense -- for and against the Rangers -- in Arlington again this season.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>Can Josh Hamilton put together two outstanding halves?</b> 
<p>This question will be weighing heavily on owners minds as they contemplate selecting Hamilton in the first round. While there's no way we can know for sure if Hamilton will be consistent before and after the break this season, we can at least try to identify some indicators that might give us a hint.
<p>Hamilton hit .310-21-95 in 377 at-bats before the break and .296-11-35 in 247 at-bats afterward. His slugging percentage dropped from .552 to .498, while his K percentage jumped from 17 percent to almost 25 percent. 
<p>Those stats are alarming, but fantasy owners should note that the decline in the second half correlated with the absence of Ian Kinsler, who played his last game on Aug. 17. Hamilton hit just four homers and knocked in 16 runs after Kinsler was hurt; he hit .287-6-24 in July and .283-3-10 in August before Kinsler's injury. Without Kinsler on base in front of him, pitchers weren't forced to be as careful with Hamilton, resulting in fewer "good" pitches to hit and fewer RBI chances. 
<p>With Kinsler back and a full season under his belt, expect Hamilton to put together two solid halves in terms of power and produce stats worthy of a first-rounder. 
<p><b>HITTERS</B> 
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Ian Kinsler. You wouldn't know it by looking at his final numbers, but Kinsler missed much of August and all of September with a sports hernia. Still, he produced numbers rivaling other elite second base options, hitting 18 homers and stealing 26 bases with a .319 average. It's greedy to expect Kinsler to hit at such a high clip again, but an average around .290 with 20-plus homers and 20-30 steals is well within reach. He's a lock to score 100-plus runs and should even get a lot of RBI opportunities in such a stacked lineup.
<br /><b>Others:</b> Chris Davis, Josh Hamilton, David Murphy, Michael Young.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Hank Blalock. The Rangers are planning to use Blalock in the DH slot this season in an effort to finally keep him healthy. He missed all but 65 games last season because of hamstring, wrist and shoulder injuries. Owners may be encouraged by Blalock's strong September (.337-8-23 in 24 games), but note that he has managed to play in just 123 games the last two seasons. Make Blalock no more than a backup option, and you shouldn't rely on him to stay healthy, even as a strict DH. 
<br /><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Nelson Cruz. The 28-year-old Cruz might finally get his chance to stick in the Rangers' lineup this season after hitting .342-37-99 with 24 SBs at Triple-A last year. Cruz will have a chance to contribute across the board in 5x5 leagues in a powerful Rangers lineup, but he'll first have to earn a starting outfield job over Brandon Boggs and Marlon Byrd. If he does, mixed leaguers should pounce. 
<br /><b>Others:</b> Taylor Teagarden.
<p><b>Going Deeper:</b> Jarrod Saltalamacchia. Salty can't seem to catch a break. With Gerald Laird out of town, he would have taken over behind the plate if not for top prospect Taylor Teagarden. Now Saltalamacchia will have to battle Teagarden this spring for playing time. This is likely to result in a platoon situation, making both players tough to rely on in mixed leagues. Even with an everyday gig, neither catcher is particularly attractive outside of AL-only leagues or two-catcher formats. Salty is a career .261 hitter without much power, while Teagarden has little experience above Double-A and struck out last season at an alarming rate in the big leagues (40.4 percent of the time). Keep an eye on this situation during spring training.

<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Frank Francisco. The only pitcher on the Rangers' staff worth owning in mixed leagues (or maybe any league, period) is the closer, and that happens to be Francisco. He assumed the closer role last September and converted five straight saves to finish the season. He has a great K-rate (11.8 K/9 last season), but his WHIP has been known to get a little high and he has a history of elbow problems. Owners shouldn't put too much faith in Francisco, who is unproven as a closer, but he should provide nice save numbers if he hangs onto the job. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Every member of the Rangers' pitching staff falls into this category because of their tendency to post atrocious numbers. No matter what type of league you're in, beware of your ERA and WHIP skyrocketing if you have any Rangers on your staff. Texas simply doesn't place much emphasis on quality pitchers. Case in point: Kevin Millwood is the No. 1 starter. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Seriously, everyone.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> C.J. Wilson/Eddie Guardado. The only Rangers pitchers who might see a sudden jump in fantasy value would be Wilson and Guardado, who would both be candidates to replace Francisco as closer if he struggles or gets hurt. Wilson had 24 saves last season, but don't forget about his 6.02 ERA and 1.64 WHIP. Guardado, 38, has plenty of closing experience, but he has been mostly a middle reliever since saving 36 games in '05. Neither would be great RP options, but they could provide a few cheap saves.
<br/><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Going Deeper:</b> Kevin Millwood. Even in an AL-only league, you're scraping the bottom of the barrel with Millwood. He might look attractive because of his 16 wins in '06 and his assumed run support, but he'll demolish your team's ERA and WHIP. Plus, he offers a subpar K/9 rate and has topped 200 innings only once in the last five years. You can do better.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> Believe it or not, there are some value picks left in Texas' stacked lineup. If you're looking for a corner infielder, check out Chris Davis ($4.5M), who averaged 11.16 SNP/G last season. He costs just as much as less productive CI options Lyle Overbay (7.44 SNP/G), Pedro Feliz (5.77) and Eric Chavez (7.00). In the outfield, David Murphy ($4.25M) sports an attractive price tag considering his 10.52 SNP/G last year. He far outperformed other OFs at his price, with Willy Taveras the closest at 8.50 SNP/G. Expect both Davis and Murphy to see big gains early this season.

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> Ian Kinsler is points-league gold. Not only does he provide 20-homer power to go with 30-steal potential, but he also has a great K-to-BB ratio (67-to-45 in '08) and his OBP has increased in every season (.375 last year). Plus, he tied for third among second baseman with 41 doubles last season despite playing just 121 games. If you're looking for a 2B who does it all, Kinsler is a great option. 
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> The Rangers offer three players who are arguably the best in the AL at their respective positions: 2B Ian Kinsler, OF Josh Hamilton and SS Michael Young. If you're forced to pick one to buy at top-dollar in an AL-only auction, Young offers the most value. First, he'll be the cheapest of the three. Second, he chips in across the board in 5x5 leagues. Third, he'll gain third-base eligibility early in the season. Lastly, SS is an extremely thin position in AL-only leagues, making Young a best buy for around $27. 
<p><i>For the Rangers' projected dollar values, <a href= http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/rangers/dollarvalues/>click here.</a></i>
<p><b>Prospect Watch:</b> Elvis Andrus is just 20, but Texas is already planning to have Michael Young move to third base to make room for the shortstop in the near future. When he gets an everyday job in the majors, Andrus will provide owners with a burst of speed (54 steals last season at Double-A), but you can forget about any power numbers (15 homers in four minor league seasons). His run totals will depend on where he fits into the Rangers lineup. Initially, he'll probably bat ninth because he won't have many (any?) at-bats above Double-A and will need some time to adjust. Consider Andrus a one-category specialist early on when he eventually takes over at SS. 
<p><b>Ballpark Factor:</b> There's a strong favoritism toward hitters in Arlington, thanks in large part to Rangers Ballpark. No park had a higher slugging percentage (.481) or saw more runs scored (12.3 per game), and the home runs (fourth with 2.52 per game) only figure to rise with the Rangers' up-and-coming sluggers -- and declining pitchers. Enjoy it when your hitters playing a series in Arlington, but beware of starting any borderline pitching options on the road against the Rangers.
