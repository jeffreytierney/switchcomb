<p><font class=headline>Top 50 prospects update</font>

<p>
<font class=text><p>With half this year's spring training contests behind us and big league rosters starting to come into focus, it's time to update our Top 50 prospect list for 2009.
<p>This ranking is not an attempt to identify the most talented prospects in professional baseball, but rather to gauge who will have the greatest impact in '09. In assessing potential impact, both talent and opportunity need to be taken into account. A prospect may be hugely talented and have a great future, but if he is unlikely to reach the bigs in '09, he won't be on this list (see my "Top 10 for 2010" for a look farther ahead). 
<p>In evaluating talent, I combined Sabermetric statistical analysis with my personal scouting observations and interviews with prospects, coaches and scouts.
<p><i>Note: For the purpose of compiling the updated list, we used the standard definition of prospect, i.e. a player with no more than 130 at-bats or 50 innings pitched in the major leagues, regardless of service time. </i>
<p><B>TOP 50 FOR 2009</b> 
<p><b>1. David Price, SP/RP, Rays.</b> Price showed his prowess as a late-inning reliever in the 2008 postseason, but it's unclear how the Rays will use him this season. He'll eventually find his way into the rotation, but it's possible he could stay in the bullpen to limit his innings, or even start out in Triple-A. A high-90s fastball and nasty slider helped Price dominate hitters in short relief last season. As a starter, he'll need to use his changeup more, but he has the poise and maturity to succeed over a full season. 
<p><b>2. Matt Wieters, C, Orioles.</b> While Wieters only made it as high as Double-A in 2008, expect him to be the Orioles' starting backstop at some point this season. The switch-hitting rookie has great hands and bat speed, and the only thing slowing him down is his defense. Wieters' footwork is sloppy and his ability to manage a big league staff is unproven. Nevertheless, once he gets his shot, expect numbers on par with Minnesota catcher Joe Mauer, but with more power. 
<p><b>3. Travis Snider, OF, Blue Jays.</b> Snider hit .301 in a late-season call-up and has a strong chance for a starting outfield spot in 2009. His power potential is tremendous, along with excellent mechanics and bat control. He uses the whole field and should hit for a decent average, although he doesn't have a consistent approach and will likely strike out in large numbers. 
<p><b>4. Cameron Maybin, OF, Marlins.</b> The trade of Josh Willingham to the Nationals opens the way for Maybin to play every day this year. Despite his talent, the Marlins rookie has a penchant for getting himself out by swinging at marginal strikes. However, Maybin showed better strike-zone discipline in a September call-up when he hit .500 in 32 at-bats, and can be counted on to get plenty of chances to learn in Florida. 
<p><b>5. Matt LaPorta, OF, Indians.</b> LaPorta's bat is major league ready and the Tribe is thin in the outfield. He's unlikely to start the year in the majors, but he should finish there. The big righthander gets excellent extension on his swing, allowing him to generate plus power to all fields. He also has good plate discipline for a young hitter and should be able to maintain a decent average as a big leaguer. 
<p><b>6. Colby Rasmus, OF, Cardinals.</b> Although his ability is unquestioned, Rasmus has been slowed by injuries and inconsistency. If he can stay healthy, Rasmus should either win a starting outfield job in spring training or get an early-season call-up. When Rasmus is locked in, he's a deadly pull hitter and an aggressive base runner with 20-20 potential. 
<p><b>7. Taylor Teagarden, C, Rangers.</b> Teagarden won't slug .829 like he did in a September big league call-up, but he'll see plenty of time behind the plate for the Rangers in 2009. Teagarden is also advanced defensively, with an above-average arm and a quick release. At the plate, Teagarden is learning to drive the ball, but has the potential to hit 20 or more home runs. 
<p><b>8. Elvis Andrus, SS, Rangers.</b>  Andrus is still raw both at the plate and in the field, but the 20-year-old has a chance to take over as the starting shortstop in Texas sometime this season. Andrus has great hands and plus bat speed, but he tends to lose his balance, which saps his power and results in high strikeout totals. He'll struggle to hit more than .250 but he should steal at least 30 bags in '09 with a full-time job.
<p><b>9. Chris Perez, RP, Cardinals.</b> Perez had a rough ride as the Cardinals' closer in September and isn't guaranteed the job to start the season. Still, he has the experience and mentality to be a ninth-inning guy who will get his shot this season. Perez has a classic power fastball/slider combo and can reach the upper 90s with his heater. He has had command problems, but when he locates down in the strike zone, Perez can be tough to hit. 
<p><b>10. Tommy Hanson, SP, Braves.</b> Hanson was one of the most effective pitchers in the minors last season and is likely to get a look in the Braves' rotation sooner rather than later.  With a plus breaking ball, deceptive fastball and an improved ability to mix pitches, Hanson appears ready to take on major league hitters after striking out 163 batters in 138 minor league innings last year. 
<p><b>11. Chris Dickerson, OF, Reds.</b> Dickerson's plate discipline improved in '08 and his production increased accordingly. He's unlikely to hit .300 over a full season but has enough leverage in his swing to drive balls to the gaps and hit 15 to 20 home runs, as well as steal 30 bases a year. Don't be surprised if he opens the season as the Reds' starting leftfielder. 
<p><b>12. Trevor Cahill, SP, A's.</b> The Athletics' rotation is once again wide open and Cahill is a prime candidate for a slot. While Cahill looks younger than his 20 years of age, he's a mature, cerebral pitcher. He won't dominate in the bigs, but can be an effective groundball pitcher by locating down and mixing his pitches. 
<p><b>13. Brett Gardner, OF, Yankees.</b> After Melky Cabrera's struggles in '08, Gardner is the best bet to be the Yankees' opening day centerfielder. After a slow start during an earlier call-up, Gardner hit .283 in September. He also swiped 13 bases in 14 attempts for the season. Gardner won't hit for power, but will get on base, score runs and steal a pile of bags. 
<p><b>14. Mat Gamel, 3B, Brewers.</b> Even if Bill Hall revives his career, Gamel will challenge him for the starting third baseman spot this year. The talented lefty uses the whole field, has good plate discipline and makes consistent contact. He doesn't have the bat speed or leverage to be a true power threat, but has good enough mechanics to hit for a high average in the majors. 
<p><b>15. Jeff Samardzija, RP, Cubs.</b> Samardzija will either start the season in the bullpen or in the minors to develop as a starter. Samardzija has the fastball life and velocity to succeed at the back of a bullpen but he'll need better command and refined secondary stuff to stick in a big league rotation. 
<p><b>16. Gaby Sanchez, 1B, Marlins.</b> The trade of Mike Jacobs opens the way for Sanchez to possibly start at first base for the Marlins this year. While Sanchez is still learning to drive the ball, he has the mechanics and strength to hit for at least average power. He's already a polished hitter with a good idea of the strike zone and an ability to use the entire field. 
<p><b>17. Jordan Zimmermann, SP, Nationals.</b> Zimmermann has flown under the radar since being drafted out of Division III Wisconsin-Stevens Point in '07. That could change this year, as the talented righty has a chance to be the Nationals' No. 5 starter. While pitching for a poor team will limit his upside this year, Zimmermann's plus fastball, good command and decent secondary offerings make him a future front-of-the-rotation starter. 
<p><b>18. Andrew McCutchen, OF, Pirates.</b> The Pirates coaches gush over McCutchen's work ethic and tools but have yet to give him a big league call-up. Having proved himself at Triple-A, and with an unsettled outfield situation in Pittsburgh, McCutchen could get his break this season. 
<p><b>19. Jason Motte, RP, Cardinals.</b> Motte will likely start the year in middle relief, but could close in '09 given the Cardinals' uncertain bullpen situation. A converted catcher who's still learning how to pitch, Motte relied on an explosive high-90s heater to strike out 110 batters in 66.2 Triple-A innings last season. He also notched 16 Ks in 11 September innings with the Cardinals. 
<p><b>20. Gio Gonzalez, SP, A's.</b> Gonzalez has the ability to pitch in a big league rotation, but he may need another season to absorb the changes the A's made to his delivery and improve his overall composure on the mound. With a good spring, he could be the sleeper in the competition for spots in Oakland's rotation this year. 
<p><b>21. Travis Ishikawa, 1B, Giants.</b> The sweet-swinging lefty has been maddeningly inconsistent, but an impressive performance with San Francisco last September (.274-3-15 in 95 at-bats) has given him a shot to start at first base in '09.  His power is still developing and his pitch recognition needs work, but he has the bat speed and power potential to be an average big league hitter. 
<p><b>22. Brett Anderson, SP, A's.</b> Anderson, like Cahill and Gonzalez, is in the mix for a rotation spot in Oakland this season, although he's a step behind his teammates. Anderson has a polished delivery and outstanding command. He'll get a shot at some point this year and should put up numbers worthy of a No. 5 starter. 
<p><b>23. Chris Tillman, SP, Orioles.</b> While Tillman is more likely to make an impact in 2010, don't count him out this year. The big righthander has a smooth delivery and a good, low-90s fastball. He'll have to locate better to handle major league hitters, but has the makings of a middle-of-the-rotation starter. 
<p><b>24. Jordan Schafer, OF, Braves.</b>  After missing 50 games in '08 for testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs, Schafer has used spring training to show that he's still one of Atlanta's top prospects. He may not start '09 in the Braves' outfield, but he's likely to finish there. A short, balanced stroke and good bat speed give him power to all fields. If he can control his emotions and become more consistent, he'll be an annual 20-20 threat for the Braves. 
<p><b>25. Brett Cecil, SP, Blue Jays.</b> With plenty of holes in the Blue Jays' rotation, Cecil may get a chance to step into a big league role in '09. Don't expect ace production, but he could win 10-12 games and put up good strikeout numbers if he lands a starting spot.
<p><b>26. Angel Salome, C, Brewers.</b> It's a matter of time before the powerful Salome supplants Jason Kendall as the Brewers' backstop. His defense will be the determining factor in when he gets a chance, but a good performance at the plate this spring or in the minors will force the issue. 
<p><b>27. Clayton Richard, SP, White Sox.</b> Richard performed adequately in eight starts with the White Sox late last season and is a candidate to be the team's No. 4 or 5 starter this year. He succeeds by keeping the ball down in the zone, inducing ground balls and limiting home runs. 
<p><b>28. Rick Porcello, SP, Tigers.</b>  The Tigers' top pitching prospect has turned heads in spring training and, while he's unlikely to start the season in the rotation, Porcello has greatly increased his chances of a mid-season call-up.  The righthander has plus pure stuff, good command and an advanced ability to change location and speed.  He won't be a No. 1 starter in '09 but it won't be long before he's the ace of the Tigers' staff.
<p><b>29. Will Venable, OF, Padres.</b> Although Venable may start the season as a fourth outfielder, expect him to crack the starting lineup before mid-season. Venable has good hands and plus bat speed, but his overall skills are average. He may develop more power as he learns to create leverage in his swing, and could have an upside of 20-25 home runs. 
<p><b>30. Nick Adenhart, SP, Angels.</b> Injuries may have opened the door for the Angels' top pitching prospect to finally win a spot in the rotation.  Adenhart's stuff is unquestioned, with a lively fastball, decent curve and change-up.  The problem has been mental approach and an inability to command his pitches early in the count. With more confidence and better execution, he's a No. 2 or No. 3 starter.
<p><b>31. Alcides Escobar, SS, Brewers.</b> Escobar's rapid development could force the Brewers to open a spot for him in '09. Despite being a free swinger at the plate, Escobar is a good defender and has great speed. If Escobar performs well in the spring, the Brewers could eventually trade J.J. Hardy or move him to second base. 
<p><b>32. Michael Bowden, SP, Red Sox.</b> Bowden doesn't have a dedicated spot in Boston's rotation, but he could get a chance in '09. Last season, Bowden's improved fastball command meant he was able to use his secondary pitches more effectively. With a polished repertoire and a good defense behind him, he could be a serviceable fantasy option. 
<p><b>33. Dexter Fowler, OF, Rockies.</b> Fowler has impressive tools, but don't be fooled by his minor league numbers (.335/.431/.515 at Double-A last year). Fowler's mechanics are awkward and experienced pitchers ate him up in the Olympics and during his September call-up. Fowler has 20-20 potential and he'll have a shot to win a big league job, but it's unclear whether he'll be ready. 
<p><b>34. Carlos Carrasco, SP, Phillies.</b> Carrasco doesn't have a spot on the Phillies roster yet, but with continued improvement in '09, it'll be hard not to bring him into the rotation. Philadelphia's top prospect, Carrasco is only 21 and is learning how to harness his ability. 
<p><b>35. Chris Getz, 2B, White Sox.</b> Getz doesn't have much power or speed, but he has good hands, makes solid contact and shows above-average plate discipline.  He's currently the leading candidate for the White Sox' second base job and should hold off fellow rookie Brent Lillibridge and Jayson Nix. If Getz does break camp as the starter, expect a decent batting average, a handful of steals and an above-average OBP. 
<p><b>36. Aaron Poreda, SP, White Sox.</b> Poreda has more potential than fellow Sox prospect Clayton Richard, but he's behind Richard in the competition for a big league job this season. With further development of his secondary pitches, Poreda could get a midseason call-up. 
<p><b>37. Fernando Martinez, OF, Mets.</b> Martinez is a top talent but his potential impact in '09 is hard to gauge. Despite plus bat speed and great hands, he has been plagued by injuries and inconsistency. If Martinez can stay healthy, he could realize his potential and eventually win a big league job. 
<p><b>38. Jake Arrieta, SP, Orioles.</b> If this was a 2010 list, Arrieta would be 20 slots higher. As it is, his role this season will be limited at best. Still, he's a top talent and could force the Orioles to give him a shot in the second half of the season. Arrieta still relies too much on his explosive fastball, but there's no doubt he has the makings of a future No. 2 or No. 3 starter. 
<p><b>39. Jason Donald, SS, Phillies.</b> With Pedro Feliz and Chase Utley both recovering from offseason surgeries, Donald may get a chance to start somewhere in the Phillies' infield in '09. Although he doesn't have much power, Donald has good balance and can drive balls to the gaps. He should hit for a decent average and could hit double-digit home runs with a handful of steals if given an everyday job.
<p><b>40. Seth Smith, OF, Rockies.</b>  If Fowler doesn't win a starting job, Smith might open '09 as the Rockies' left fielder. Smith's swing mechanics aren't the smoothest, but he has average power and good plate discipline. If he wins the job, playing half his games at Coors Field should ensure a decent average and good power numbers.
<p><b>41. Josh Geer, SP, Padres.</b> Although he doesn't have great pure stuff, Geer is the leading candidate to be the Padres' No. 5 starter this year. Given his modest velocity, Geer needs to have precise command to succeed. However, with a plus change, an average slider and the ability to locate on both sides of the plate, he can be a serviceable back-of-the-rotation starter. 
<p><b>42. James McDonald, SP, Dodgers.</b> While it's doubtful he'll win a rotation spot in spring training, McDonald is very likely to start for Los Angeles at some point in '09. The slender righthander has a plus curveball, a good fastball and an effective change-up. Ultimately, he profiles as a middle-of-the-rotation starter. 
<p><b>43. J.P. Arencibia, C, Toronto.</b> Although he's no better than No. 3 on the Toronto depth chart at catcher, Arencibia could end '09 as the Blue Jays' starting backstop. While he made strides at the plate in '08, Arencibia still doesn't have great strike zone discipline. The more he can improve his pitch recognition, the greater his chances of receiving a midseason call-up. 
<p><b>44. Jess Todd, SP, Cardinals.</b> He won't win a rotation spot this spring, but he'll be first in line for a call-up if an injury strikes. He's not a hard thrower, but his delivery is deceptive and he keeps the ball down. Todd is the most advanced of the Cardinals' pitching prospects and could have success at the back of the rotation. 
<p><b>45. Lou Marson, C, Phillies.</b> While the Phillies' backstop picture is cluttered, Marson is a dark horse to end up with the job before '09 is over. He has a short swing, good plate discipline and consistent mechanics. Marson doesn't try to do too much with the ball, which limits his power, but enhances his consistency. 
<p><b>46. Everth Cabrera, SS, Padres.</b> Cabrera led professional baseball with 73 stolen bases last year and could put up good speed numbers even in a limited role with the Padres. But his lack of experience and inability to make consistent contact at the plate may mean being offered back to his original team, the Rockies, if he doesn't make the Padres' 25-man roster.
<p><b>47. David Huff, SP, Indians.</b> Huff has a full arsenal of pitches, including an effective change-up and a good sinker, which he used effectively in '08. Huff's velocity is average and he'll need to be crafty and precise to have sustained success, but he could eventually fill the back end of the Tribe's rotation. 
<p><b>48. Jonathon Niese, SP, Mets.</b> Niese isn't expected to be in the Mets' rotation out of spring training, but he's likely to get a shot at some point in the first half of '09. While he's not overpowering, Niese has three effective pitches and is learning how to mix his offerings and set up hitters.
<p><b>49. Luis Montanez, OF, Orioles.</b> Montanez is not a long-term solution for the Orioles lineup, but he's a candidate to play left field or DH this season. Montanez showed good power and improved discipline last season. However, his approach is still inconsistent, and his ability to make adjustments is unproven. 
<p><b>50. Mitchell Boggs, SP, Cardinals.</b> Boggs got a late-season audition in St. Louis last year and, along with Todd, will probably fill a rotation spot sometime in '09. Boggs has average command, but is consistent and uses his slider effectively. He'll need to be more precise in his location to succeed on a big league level, however.
