<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Mets.</i>

<b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/mets/statistics/projections/>Mets stat projections</a></b>
<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>The Mets have been mostly quiet this offseason, save for one major $37 million signing. With closer Billy Wagner likely lost for '09 after undergoing Tommy John surgery, New York signed Francisco Rodriguez, the top free-agent reliever on the market, to a three-year deal.
<p>It was a great move for the Mets, who desperately needed someone to anchor a bullpen that struggled in the final two months last season without Wagner. To further strengthen their 'pen, the Mets also acquired Seattle reliever J.J. Putz in a three-team, 12-player trade. The former closer will be the setup man, assuming he can stay healthy. Free agent Tim Redding also joins the Mets and has a chance to be the fifth starter. 
<p>Meanwhile, the Mets kept their powerful offense intact and should benefit from having Ryan Church and Luis Castillo fully healthy. In short, there will be no shortage of fantasy options in New York.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>Will the arrival of K-Rod mean more victories for the Mets' starters?</b> 
<p>Yes, but not as many as you might think. While K-Rod should bring stability and a few extra wins for the starters, the other relievers will have to do better jobs of getting to the closer. 
<p>Johan Santana stands to benefit the most from having Rodriguez around because he will consistently pitch deep into games, helping bridge the gap between starter and closer. But until Mike Pelfrey, Oliver Perez, John Maine, et al show more consistency, Rodriguez can't do much to help them in the win column. Draft Pelfrey, Perez and Maine based on their own potential, not the presence of K-Rod. 
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> David Wright. What's not to like about Wright? Over the past four seasons, the Mets' third baseman has given his owners an average of 29 home runs, 112 RBIs, 106 runs and 22 steals to go with an average of .311. You will be hard-pressed to find a more dependable, consistent player who fills the stat sheet like Wright, so don't hesitate to grab him with a top-five pick.
<br /><b>Others:</b> Carlos Beltran, Carlos Delgado, Jose Reyes
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Luis Castillo. Remember when Castillo would steal 20-plus bases and hit above .300? Well, that hasn't happened in the same season since '03. Now 33, Castillo doesn't run as much and has seen his average drop in each of the past two seasons. He has had trouble staying healthy in New York, and the Mets are just looking for a reason to replace him. 
<br /><b>Others:</b> None. 
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Ryan Church. Before suffering his second concussion of the year in June, Church hit .311-9-31 with 33 runs in April and May. Unfortunately for his owners, he wasn't the same when he finally returned, hitting just .219 in 33 games after the break. But that means Church will come cheap this season. A healthy Church is worth a gamble hitting in a potent Mets lineup. 
<br /><b>Others:</b> None. 
<p><b>Going Deeper:</b> Daniel Murphy. The rookie impressed in a brief audition last season, hitting .313 in 131 at-bats, and he should get a shot at starting in left field this year or may even play second. Murphy doesn't have great power or speed, but he hits for a high average and should contribute enough runs to satisfy NL-only leaguers, especially if he hits near the top of the order.

</table>
<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Johan Santana. It's risky drafting a pitcher in the first two rounds, but Santana is definitely worth it. He has logged 200-plus innings in each of his five seasons as a full-time starter and has at least 15 victories in each of those seasons to go along with outstanding peripherals. Also, having a reliable starter like Santana lowering your WHIP and ERA allows you to take a few more risks at other spots in your rotation. The lefty should be one of the first three pitchers drafted this spring. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Francisco Rodriguez
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> John Maine. A sore shoulder limited Maine to just 25 starts last season, and he had arthroscopic surgery to remove a lesion in the back of his right shoulder socket in September. Maine should be ready for spring training, but it's concerning that his ERA, WHIP and BB/9 all rose last year while his K/9 dropped in comparison to his breakout '07 season. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> J.J. Putz
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Oliver Perez. The lefthander could easily fit in the "Buyer Beware" category because of his erratic performances, but Perez will be a nice gamble in the later rounds. Perez showed improvement last season once pitching coach Dan Warthen joined the team in June, and a full season under Warthen should help him find a little consistency. Perez could be a great source of wins and Ks, but beware the walks. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Mike Pelfrey
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Jonathon Niese. If it wasn't for the Tim Redding signing, Niese would have a great shot at opening the season as the Mets' No. 5 starter. Niese should still log plenty of innings out of the 'pen, though, and he could get a chance to start if injuries strike or if Redding struggles. Niese sported a K/9 rate of 8.3 in the minors but also carried an unimpressive 1.36 WHIP in that time. He's only 22, so he has a lot to learn, but he'll be worth tracking if he lands a spot in the rotation.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b>
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> David Wright, Jose Reyes and Carlos Beltran are among the top 12 most expensive hitters in SN's Ultimate Fantasy Baseball game. But they're also worth the lofty prices, as all three finished in the top seven in total points. If you're looking to splurge at a certain position, the Mets are a good place to shop. 
<p><i>To play Sporting News' Ultimate Fantasy Baseball, <a href= http://www.sportingnews.com/games/baseball/fullseason/ultimate/home.php>click here.</i></a>
<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> David Wright is an elite option in any format, but he's especially valuable in points leagues. He's a do-it-all hitter, consistently topping 100 runs, 100 RBIs, 30 HRs and 40 doubles to go along with an average around .300 and a career OPS of .922. To top it off, he also has 30-steal potential and has gotten his K-to-BB ratio closer to 1-to-1. Wright makes a great case to be the No. 1-overall pick in points leagues.  
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> The Mets offer three players who are arguably the best at their respective positions in Johan Santana, David Wright and Jose Reyes. If you're targeting any of these three (or their peers), it's a good idea to nominate another elite option first. That helps set the market for the upper-tier players at that position and takes one owner out of the bidding.

<p><b>Position Battle:</b> The Mets had Daniel Murphy try out second base in the Arizona Fall League, and although the initial reviews haven't been positive, Murphy could still challenge Luis Castillo. It's no secret that the Mets are disappointed with Castillo and have been looking for a replacement. Even if Murphy isn't the answer, expect Castillo to be on the hot seat this spring. 
<p><b>Ballpark factor:</b> The Mets unveil their new ballpark, Citi Field, this season. The biggest differences between Citi Field and Shea Stadium are the deeper power alleys in left center and right center. Those should turn a few would-be Shea homers into doubles or even outs. Although Shea Stadium was already generally a pitchers park, expect the new digs to favor pitchers even more. But don't expect to see a noticeable difference in anyone's numbers this season because of the new park.
