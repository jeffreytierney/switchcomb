<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Twins.</i>

<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>At one point this offseason, I glanced at the TV and the new MLB Network was on. Along the bottom of the screen was a "Key Additions" ticker. Every team had at least one player listed, but when the Minnesota Twins came along, it simply said this: "(None)." 
<p>Yes, the Twins were the only team who hadn't made a significant acquisition -- and this was a team that missed the playoffs by one game.
<p>Since then, the Twins have made two notable signings -- reliever Luis Ayala and third basemen Joe Crede for a combined $3.8 million (possibly more if incentives are met). That's roughly what Yankees' officials spent on dry cleaning to make sure their suits looked good for all their introductory press conferences this winter.
<p>But just because Minnesota didn't make any flashy signings or major trades doesn't mean they won't compete. The Twins feature one of the best young rotations in baseball, a solid lineup with two proven superstars and arguably the best closer in the majors. In other words, there's plenty of fantasy talent.
<p>There are some concerns, of course. Can Denard Span, Alexi Casilla and Carlos Gomez improve, or will they take steps back? Can a rotation with five members under 28 stay healthy <i>and</i> be consistently effective? Is the bullpen good enough to preserve leads and get the ball to Joe Nathan? Can Joe Mauer and/or Joe Crede stay healthy? 
<p>Despite all the questions, there's little reason to doubt Minnesota. After surviving last year's rash of defections and trades, we know they'll be just fine this year despite the lack of activity. In what's been a tumultuous offseason for most teams and baseball in general, fantasy owners should learn to appreciate the stability.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>Who's the odd man out in the outfield?</b> 
<P>Last season, Michael Cuddyer missed 91 games because of finger and foot injuries, but he's 100 percent heading into spring training this year. Great, right? Well, not really. Cuddyer's presence gives the Twins four outfielders for three spots. It's a good problem for the Twins to have, but it's still tough to sit a player as talented as Cuddyer, Carlos Gomez, Denard Span or Delmon Young every day. Ideally, one of these players could fill in at DH, but Jason Kubel and Joe Mauer handle the majority of those duties, and you don't really want to sit one of those guys either.
<p>Manager Ron Gardenhire indicated this offseason that he'd prefer Span, Gomez and Cuddyer most nights, and unless one of them struggles during the spring, that will likely be the opening day alignment. Still, the Twins have a history of rotating their lineups and trying to keep everyone "fresh," so this could be a nightmare situation for owners in weekly leagues. Chances are, Span will play most days because he's the only true leadoff hitter on the team, but Gomez, Cuddyer and Young will rotate in and out. All four of these players have potential mixed-league value, so hopefully something gets worked out. This is definitely a position battle to watch during spring training.
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Justin Morneau. As great as Morneau has been over the past several seasons, fantasy owners are getting frustrated with his late-season power outages. Since 2006, Morneau has hit 88 HRs -- only 14 of which have come after July. Morneau altered his offseason workout routine to (hopefully) give him more stamina throughout the season. If he can be more consistent with his power, he could finish the year as a top-three first baseman.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Joe Mauer.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Joe Crede. Twins fans are excited about Crede manning the hot corner, but there are more reasons to be concerned than optimistic. For starters, Crede has only played in 144 games the past two years because of back injuries -- not a good sign when your team plays 81 home games on turf. There's also Crede's career splits at the Metrodome: .219, five homers, 17 RBIs in 169 at-bats. Crede has mixed-league potential if he can stay healthy, but fantasy owners shouldn't count on that. Monitor him early, and if he gets the cushy No. 5 spot in the lineup or he starts out hot, grab him. Otherwise, leave him be and let another owner deal with his inevitable DL-stint.
<br/><b>Others:</b>  Jason Kubel.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Delmon Young. Last year, Young was our "Must Own" Minnesota player. How quickly things can change, huh? Even though Young might not be Ron Gardenhire's No. 1 (or No. 2 or No. 3) choice for the outfield, he could force his way into the starting lineup with a strong spring. Fantasy owners have soured on Young because of his disappointing power numbers (just 23 homers the past two years), but you have to remember one important thing: <i>he's</i> just 23. On top of that, he improved noticeably over the second half last year (.297, seven HRs, 33 RBIs in 65 games). Young still has tons of upside, even if Gardenhire doesn't realize it. As soon as Gardy figures it out, Young will be a great value as a No. 3 OF. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Alexi Casilla, Denard Span, Michael Cuddyer, Carlos Gomez.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Brendan Harris and Brian Buscher were slated to platoon at third base before the Joe Crede signing, but now Harris will be forced into a utility role and Buscher could be sent down to Triple-A. Even so, with Crede's injury history, one (or both, depending on Nick Punto's performance at SS) could be regulars in the Twins' lineup before the All-Star break. Neither will hit for much power, but Harris' versatility and Buscher's penchant for hitting with runners in scoring position (.386 last year) give them both potential AL-only value.

<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B> 
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Francisco Liriano. He wasn't quite ready in his first go-round after returning from Tommy John surgery last season (0-3, 11.32 ERA, 2.71 WHIP), but after being sent down to work out the kinks, he returned with a fury. He wasn't quite as dominant as he was in '06, but fantasy owners were more than content with a 6-1 record, 2.74 ERA, 1.19 WHIP and 60 Ks in 65.2 innings. Most pitchers say they don't really feel "back" until the second year after surgery. That has to be a scary thought for AL hitters.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Scott Baker, Joe Nathan.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Nick Blackburn. Blackburn is yet another of Minnesota's quality young pitchers, but he's not quite as appealing to fantasy owners. His low K-rate is one reason (4.47 K/9 ratio), and so is his '08 workload. Blackburn tossed 193.1 innings last year, which is 33 more than his previous professional high. That's slightly over the 30-inning mark most teams try to adhere to. Blackburn could be poised for injury or a sharp drop in production. His rocky September (5.64 ERA, 1.55 WHIP) could be an indication of things to come.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Glen Perkins.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Fantasy owners know about Kevin Slowey, but most owners don't realize how good he is. Last year, Slowey posted a 3.99 ERA and 1.15 WHIP while striking out 123 batters in 160.1 innings. Most impressive was the way Slowey improved after his disappointing rookie campaign. In almost 100 more innings in '08, Slowey gave up just six more homers than in '07. If he continues to lower his HR rate and improve his K rate, the 24-year-old righthander will be a legit No. 2 SP. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Jose Mijares made a splash for the Twins in September by compiling a 0.87 ERA and 0.29 WHIP in 10.1 innings. The 24-year-old lefty reliever also pitched well in the minors in '08 (2.70 ERA, 1.20 WHIP, 41 Ks in 36.2 innings), and he's expected to break camp as a member of the Twins' bullpen. There are concerns about his maturity, but Mijares appears to have the tools to fill the Twins' eighth-inning role. If he gets the chance, AL-only owners, and possibly mixed-league owners, should take notice.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> Priced at $4.50 million, Scott Baker isn't even one of the top-50 most-expensive pitchers in Ultimate Fantasy Baseball. That makes the 27-year-old righthander even more intriguing this year. He was one of only 12 SPs to finish '08 with an ERA under 3.50 and a WHIP under 1.20. Throw in a solid 7.36 K/9 ratio, and you have yourself a bargain.

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> Carlos Gomez is an exciting up-and-coming player, but he's points-league poison because of his low OBP (.296) and high strikeout rate (roughly once in every four at-bats). Gomez should get better this season, but he still likely won't do enough to really help points leaguers. He's better in a 5x5 Roto or H2H format.
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> There's no getting around it -- Joe Nathan is going to cost a lot. Because of this, it's best to nominate him early. You'll either get him a little cheaper because managers are holding out for SPs or offensive players, or you'll cause another manager to overbid, thus weakening their bankroll for later in the auction.

<p><b>Ballpark Factor:</b> The Metrodome ranks 22nd on our <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/ballparks/index.html>Ballpark Power Index</a>, but that doesn't mean Twins' hitters don't thrive there. Minnesota hit 20 points higher at home and scored 33 more runs last season. The Metrodome favors lefties, which helps explain why several of Minnesota's lefthanded and switch hitters (Mauer, Casilla, Kubel, Punto) hit at least 30 points higher at home in '08. The Twins will move outdoors to Target Field next year, so fantasy owners will be hoping the "Homer Dome" is sent out in style.
<p><b>Injury update:</B> The oft-injured Joe Mauer underwent kidney surgery in December, and he decided to skip the WBC in order to focus on his rehab. He's already working out with the team, and he is not expected to miss any regular-season games. Don't be alarmed if he sees a fewer at-bats in spring training. The Twins won't rush him back, and Mauer doesn't need much time to get his swing up to speed.
