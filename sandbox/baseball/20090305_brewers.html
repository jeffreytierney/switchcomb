<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Brewers.</i>

<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>You have to admire the Brewers' guts. With Ben Sheets in a contract year and the playoffs in sight, Milwaukee went all-in last season, trading their best prospect (and others) to the Indians in exchange for half a season of CC Sabathia. And what a half-season it was. Going 11-2 with a 1.65 ERA, Sabathia piloted the Brewers to their first playoff appearance since the glory days of <a href=http://www.go4thestars.com/10282gt.jpg>Gorman Thomas and powder-blue unis</a>. 
<P>And then, just like that, it was over. The Phillies beat the Brewers in the NLDS. Sabathia went to the Yankees. Sheets went ... well, nowhere for the time being.
<P>All of which leaves the Brewers with lots of offense and plenty of questions about whether or not their pitching can hold up its end of the bargain. Ryan Braun, Prince Fielder, Corey Hart, J.J. Hardy ... all of the fantasy-relevant hitters are (a) returning and (b) in their prime. And after a few years of improvising in the closer's role, Milwaukee went out and got the most proven of "proven closers," Trevor Hoffman. 
<P>You have to get a lead to protect it, however. A rotation that tied for second in the National League in ERA last season will have to hope that a home-grown young gun can step in to make the loss of two great pitchers hurt a little less. 
<P>For Bob Uecker's sake, let's hope he can.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>Can the Brewers -- and fantasy owners -- count on Yovani Gallardo?</b> 
<p>With the departures of CC Sabathia and Ben Sheets, the Brewers need Gallardo to step into the role of staff ace. That's a lot of pressure to put on a 23-year-old with only 134.1 big-league innings to his credit. On the bright side, they have been 134.1 good innings -- he has logged 8.1 strikeouts per nine innings (2.69 K/BB) and a 3.53 fielding-independent ERA since his 2007 debut. That's the problem, though: 110.1 of his innings came in '07. Knee and ACL injuries limited him to just four starts last season, so it's hard to make a confident prediction of what he'll deliver. If you're a glass-half-full type, you see the talent. If you're more glass-half-empty, you see the injury risk. We have Gallardo ranked as No. 3 pitcher in a 12-team mixed league, and that balance of risk and reward feels about right. Counting on him to carry your rotation is a mistake, but giving him the opportunity to help isn't. 
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> There are two Ryan Brauns in the majors at this time, but if there were any justice in the world, the other Ryan Braun would have to legally change his name to "The Other Ryan Braun." The Brewers' left fielder won't qualify at third base this season, which undeniably stinks, but five-stat studs like Braun don't need to hide behind cutesy position eligibility ploys. After compiling a .324 batting average in his rookie season, Braun hit .285 (with a .308 BABIP) last year despite a slight uptick in his line-drive rate. A third year of data will give us a better idea of what "normal" means for Braun, but it seems reasonable to expect him to bounce back to the .290s at the very least. Add in double-digit steals and a legitimate shot at 40 homers, and Braun makes a very sensible pick at the end of the first round (I should know -- I took him 9th overall in our last <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/mock_draft/1_12.html>mock draft</a>).  
<br/><B>Others:</b> Prince Fielder, Corey Hart.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> I'm in a band with some fantasy nerds, and at our last practice we discussed the curious case of Rickie Weeks. Here's a guy who, if he ever managed to put together a full season, would be a great bet for a 20-20 season at an up-the-middle position. Not only that, but he's still in what should be his prime years, as he doesn't turn 27 until September. With all that upside, the fact remains that he's a career .245 hitter who has yet to play even 140 games in a given season. Even more troubling, he has managed just a .243/.338/.399 line against right-handed pitching (major-league average is .263/.332/.415). Until evolution throws us a curveball, most pitchers are going to be right-handed. As much as I like Weeks' potential, I can't ignore the fact that he hasn't really capitalized on it yet. Mixed-leaguers can draft him for their bench or MI spot, but that's as far as I'd go.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Jason Kendall, Bill Hall.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Mike Cameron missed the first 25 games of last season after putting too much sugar on his Cheerios, yet he still managed to hit 25 homers and steal 17 bases. His average (.243) wasn't pretty, but he still did enough to <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/statistics/sortableStatsShell.html?sortCategory=5X5&duration=365&year=2008&league=undefined&position=OF&page=1>rank as a No. 5 outfielder</a> in mixed leagues. It's the kind of thing Cameron has been doing for years, but that very consistency (and the fear that he might suddenly realize that he's 36 years old) might deflate Cameron's value come draft time. Sure, he's old, but he hasn't shown any signs that it bothers him. Given the chance to draft starter-level value in the bench rounds, don't let Mike Cameron go.
<br/><b>Others:</b> J.J. Hardy.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> There's a lot of spring training left to go, but it looks like Chris Duffy is at least in the discussion for a bench role with the Brewers. You might remember Duffy as a "2007 Steals Sleeper" guy, but prolonged shoulder issues that wiped out his entire '08 season have reduced him to NL-only flier status. If Mike Cameron were to break down, Duffy would be an option to replace him in center field. Despite not having played in the majors since '07, Duffy is only 28-years-old and still can run (shoulder problems kept him off the field, not anything leg-related). Obviously, the closer you draft to Opening Day the better, but Duffy could help NL-only owners with steals if given the opportunity.

<p><B>PITCHERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Having experienced the Great Eric Gagne Trainwreck of '08, the Brewers went and got the all-time saves leader to lock down their ninth-inning leads. Trevor Hoffman might not be the lights-out closer he was in his heyday, but he still gets the job done with a steady diet of fastballs and changeups. He saved 30 games for a terrible team last season (which says a lot about the relationship between a team's winning percentage and save opportunities -- i.e., there really isn't one) while striking out more than a batter per inning. Despite leaving Petco, he's a safe bet as your No. 2 reliever. Hoffman had a 3.07 road ERA with 8.2 K/9 over the last three seasons.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Yovani Gallardo.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> You look at Dave Bush's line from '08, and it doesn't look half-bad. He had a 4.18 ERA, which trumped the NL average of 4.30, and he even logged 180-plus innings for the third straight season. If you squint, he almost looks like a mixed-leaguer. Right? Not exactly. Fact is, Bush's peripherals (which include an unsustainably low BABIP, an ever-descending K rate, and a declining K/BB rate) suggest that he got more than a little lucky with his ERA. It doesn't help that Bush's lifetime ERA on the road -- where he pitches roughly half the time -- is 5.18. Mixed-leaguers need more consistency than that. Bush is likely to regress this season, and even NL-only owners should view him as nothing more than a solid No. 4.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Jeff Suppan, Braden Looper.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> If you like to live dangerously, might I suggest Manny Parra? The 26-year-old lefty struck out 147 batters in 166 innings last season, but he also walked 75 batters and allowed an opponents batting average of .278. However, note that Parra's BABIP mark of .337 was sixth-highest in the majors. With better luck on balls in play, he very easily could have an ERA below league-average (I know it's annoying to hear so much about luck, but pitchers can only control so much when the ball is in play). With K rates like Parra has posted, he's an upside pick with mixed-league potential.
<br/><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> The Brewers keep giving Carlos Villanueva chances to start, but it's pretty clear that he does better out of the bullpen. He has a 3.59 ERA with a 8.6 K/9 as a reliever vs. a 4.40 ERA and 6.1 K/9 as a starter. Given a full season as a reliever, Villanueva could log enough innings (and strikeouts) to help NL-only owners as a No. 2 reliever even without a closing gig.

<font class=text>	
<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> The Ultimate Salary Cap game is a good forum for a well-reasoned risk. Unlike a draft in which you can never get your pick back, or an auction in which you can never get a refund, our salary cap game allows you to take a risk, see how it goes, and sell off if need be. With just a $3.75M buy-in, Yovani Gallardo is a great option in this format. If he pitches like you think he will, you're sitting pretty. If he goes down with an injury or just underwhelms, no biggie. He didn't cost that much to begin with. 
<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> You should know by now that I'm a card-carrying member of the Ryan Braun Uber-Fan Club. That doesn't mean I can't see his faults. While Braun is a first-round type in Roto leagues, his seeming refusal to take a walk makes him a third-round type in points leagues. He walked just 42 times last year, good for <i>145th</i> in the majors. With Braun's power he should OBP .400 easy, but last year he only managed a mediocre .335. Once he improves his selectivity, Braun's points-league status will catch up with his Roto value. 
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> Check out our <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/rankings/sp/>SP rankings</a> at the $17 mark. You'll see a cluster of young guns with considerable upside and plenty of question marks: Joba Chamberlain, our boy Yovani Gallardo, Ricky Nolasco and John Danks. None of these guys has put together back-to-back strong seasons. But consider that, for a dollar less, I could get Roy Oswalt, who has pitched 200-plus innings with sparkling ERAs for five straight seasons. I like exciting young pitchers, but I like bargains even more.
<p><b>Doin' the Splits:</b> To this point, Prince Fielder is a .254/.357/.472 hitter during day games, and a .293/.381/.573 hitter at night. ... In his first season as a Brewer, Mike Cameron hit .243/.331/.438 at home and .259/.345/.482 on the road. ... Both Manny Parra and Dave Bush had home ERAs in the 3's last season -- and road ERAs in the 5's. ... While Jeff Suppan's three-year stats would suggest that he's a second-half Superman, closer inspection reveals that his 3.84 post-All-Star break ERA since '06 is largely the product of an especially good run (6-2, 2.39 ERA) that season.
<p><b>Prospect Watch:</b> Shortstop Alcides Escobar is known primarily for his glove, but he did hit .328/.363/.434 with 34 steals as a 21-year-old at Double-A Huntsville last season. J.J. Hardy has the shortstop gig locked down, so it's not clear where Escobar fits in the Brewers' plans for '09 without an injury or trade. He'll likely start the season at Triple-A and wait for his next trip to the bigs. NL-only owners looking for steals should be interested when that happens.
