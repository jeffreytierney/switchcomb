<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Pirates.</i>
<p><b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/pirates/index.html>Pirates team page</a></b><br/>
<b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/pirates/statistics/projections/>Pirates stat projections</a></b>
<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<P> Last season, the Pirates finished with the worst ERA in the National League (5.08) and third-worst ERA in the majors. In 2007, they finished with the third-worst ERA in the NL (4.93) and fifth-worst ERA in the majors.
<p>Pirates' officials showed their recognition of this obvious problem by going out and signing ...  zero pitchers this offseason.
<p>Well, that's not true, they did sign Virgil Vazquez as a free agent. So, you know, they got that going for them ... which is nice.
<p>Yes, it's more of the same for a Pirates organization that hasn't had a winning season since 1992, and that's certainly not a good thing.
<p>Pittsburgh did sign a few guys who could help at the plate (Eric Hinske, Craig Monroe, Ramon Vazquez), but no other significant upgrades were made. Ultimately, the Pirates are going to be banking on their starting pitchers (Zach Duke, Ian Snell, Tom Gorzelanny) returning to past "glory;" several young players (Andy LaRoche, Brandon Moss, Nyjer Morgan and/or Steve Pearce) breaking out; and their returning "stars" (Nate McLouth, Adam LaRoche, Ryan Doumit, Paul Maholm, Matt Capps) remaining consistent.
<p>Is it a winning formula? Probably not, but that doesn't mean fantasy owners should avoid <i>all</i> things Pittsburgh on draft day. Just, you know, most things.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>Can Paul Maholm avoid the "Year After" curse?</b> 
<p>I'm convinced there's a hex going on in the Pirates' clubhouse. It started in 2005, and it affects any starting pitcher who had a decent season the year before.
<p>Back in '05, it was Oliver Perez. The promising young lefty had gone 12-10 with a 2.98 ERA, 1.15 WHIP and 239 Ks in '04, and fantasy owners loved his potential. But he had a disastrous '05, going 7-5 with a 5.85 ERA, 1.67 WHIP and 97 Ks while dealing with an assortment of injuries.
<p>The next year, it was Zach Duke, another lefty. He had gone 8-2 with a 1.81 ERA, 1.20 WHIP and 58 Ks as a rookie in '05. But in '06, he went 10-15 with a 4.47 ERA, 1.50 WHIP and 117 Ks. At least he didn't get injured.
<p>The curse took a break in '07 (mainly because no one pitched especially well in '06), but it made up for that by rearing its ugly head twice in '08. Both Ian Snell and Tom Gorzelanny saw their production decline sharply.
<p>That brings us to Paul Maholm, who was Pittsburgh's best pitcher last year. The 26-year-old lefty enjoyed a breakout season (9-9, 3.71 ERA, 1.28 WHIP, 139 Ks in 206.1 innings), but if history repeats itself, he's in for a rough '09. 
<P>Yes, it's silly to predict a decline for Maholm based on what <i>other</i> Pirates' pitchers have done in the past, but there's clearly something going on in Pittsburgh. Perhaps the coaching staff doesn't know how to handle and develop young pitchers. Whatever it is, it's tough to completely trust any of the Pirates' hurlers this year. Maholm is probably the best of the bunch, but he comes with obvious risks. Beware of the "Pirate Curse."
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Nate McLouth. Before the start of last season, McLouth wasn't even expected to win a starting job in the Pirates' outfield, but his strong spring resulted in playing time, and he never looked back. McLouth was one of nine players to go 20/20, and he tied for sixth in the majors in runs scored (113). He finished the year strong (.309/.385/.500, three HRs, 17 RBIs, nine SBs in September), and perhaps most impressive, he was only caught stealing three times all season -- all of which came in April. At only 27, McLouth is still in his prime, so there's little reason to expect a total dropoff. He looks poised for another solid, stat-stuffing season.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Ryan Doumit.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Adam LaRoche. When you draft Adam LaRoche, you know what you're getting -- a batting average between .270 and .280, 20-25 HRs, 80-85 RBIs and 65-75 runs. You should also know you're getting next to nothing in April. LaRoche has failed to hit above .214 in any of the past five Aprils, and he's been under .164 in his two Aprils with Pittsburgh. To go along with that, he's only hit four homers in April over the past two seasons. Roto owners can live with that because LaRoche's production tends to even out, but H2H owners should have a backup ready for the first month or two of the season.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Jack Wilson, Steve Pearce.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Eric Hinske. Last season, only 25 players hit at least 20 HRs and stole at least 10 bases. Hinske (20/10) was one of them, and he did it in only 381 at-bats for Tampa. If Hinske can find his way into regular playing time with the Pirates (and with two outfield spots up for grabs and a less-than-stellar option at 3B, he might), he has considerable sleeper value, especially in NL-only leagues. The 31-year-old former AL Rookie of the Year won't hit for a high average, but his power-speed potential and positional versatility makes him a nice late-round target in deep mixed leagues.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Brandon Moss.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Last season in SN's <i>Fantasy Baseball's Owner Manual</i>, I said this: "I don't get [Dustin Pedroia being drafted 126th overall]. He has (nearly) the same stats as Freddy Sanchez, who wasn't even drafted." Yes, I compared Pedroia, the 2008 AL MVP, to Freddy Sanchez. Yikes. What made the comparison even more tragically comical was that Sanchez completely fell apart in '08. His OBP was an unsightly .298 and his RBIs fell by nearly 30. With his eligibility down to just 2B, he has virtually no fantasy value outside of the final-rounds of NL-only drafts.

</table>
<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B> 
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Matt Capps. A right shoulder injury sidelined Capps for almost two months last season, but he still remains a quality closer. His K-rate (6.54 last season, down from 7.29 in '07) keeps him from being "elite," but his peripherals (3.02 ERA, 0.97 WHIP) are solid. Owners will likely devalue Capps because he "plays for a bad team," but remember -- George Sherrill and Trevor Hoffman closed for teams about as bad as the Pirates were last year. Both hit the 30-save mark. In fact, six of the 15 closers who saved 30 games last year came from teams below .500. A bad team doesn't necessarily bring down a closer's value, and Capps does enough in other categories to be a strong No. 2.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Paul Maholm.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Tom Gorzelanny. He was almost an All-Star in '07 when he went 14-10 with a 3.88 ERA, 1.40 WHIP and 135 Ks in 202.1 innings. Last year, he was sent to Triple-A. We know the 26-year-old lefty has talent, but it's unclear how effective he can be. He was one of the worst pitchers in the majors last year, so even NL-only leaguers should be wary. However, if he pitches well out of the gate, mixed-leaguers shouldn't completely ignore him. We've seen him be a backend mixed-league starter before, so it wouldn't be a shock to see him return to that form.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Zach Duke.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Ian Snell. Snell fell off almost as much as Gorzelanny last year, but he had his best month in September (3.67 ERA, 1.37 ERA, 25 Ks in 27 innings), which could be a sign that's poised for a comeback season. In '07, Snell went 9-12 with a 3.76 ERA, 1.33 WHIP and 177 Ks in 208 innings. This could be a make-or-break season for the 27-year-old righthander, and his career 7.70 K/9 ratio shows that he can be an impact starter in fantasy leagues. Of course, if he repeats his 4.87 BB/9 ratio from '08, he won't be any good to anyone. Monitor his control this spring. If his walks are down, he might be worth a late-round pick in deep mixed leagues. He'll likely be on your waiver wire, however, so don't be afraid to grab him if he starts out hot.
<br/><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Jeff Karstens was part of the Xavier Nady-Damaso Marte trade last year, and he immediately made a name for himself by taking a perfect game into the eighth inning against the Diamondbacks in his second outing with Pittsburgh. He finished the year with a respectable 4.03 and 1.34 WHIP in nine starts. Karstens was solid for the Yankees in '06 and in the minors in '07 and '08 (3.80 ERA, 1.18 WHIP in Triple-A last year), so he could be a decent NL-only contributor if he wins a spot in the Pirates rotation this season. His K-rate isn't great (4.03 in the majors last year, but 7.21 in the minors), but he can still be a solid innings filler.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</B>
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> Paul Maholm checks in at $3.75M in SN's Ultimate Fantasy game. That's a nice price considering he scored more SN points/game last year than several of the SPs ranked ahead of him (Matt Cain, Oliver Perez, Mark Buehrle, Jered Weaver). However, owners might get an even better value on Maholm if they wait until after the first week of the season to add him. Maholm's first two starts will be at St. Louis and at Cincinnati. Last season, Maholm was noticeably better at home, going 7-2 with a 3.36 ERA and 1.18 WHIP. On the road, he went 2-7 with a 4.13 ERA and 1.40 WHIP. His price will come down after what could be a rocky first week. But after that, he'll get two home starts (either Houston and Atlanta or Atlanta and Florida), then a possible start at San Diego -- the best pitchers park in baseball.

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> Nate McLouth is a solid player in any format, but he's even more valuable in points league. He tied for 11th last year in extra-base hits (76), and he had the third-lowest strikeout percentage (15.6) among players in the top 11. Only Albert Pujols (10.3) and Aubrey Huff (14.9) were better. It would be nice if McLouth walked a little more (9.8 percent BB rate), but his all-around game is still good enough to make him a top-tier points league outfielder.
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> Most people consider Geovany Soto, Brian McCann, Joe Mauer and Russell Martin the "elite" catching options. Some would even put Victor Martinez in that group. After them, Ryan Doumit is the next-best-thing. If you throw his name out early, you'll likely be able to get him a little cheaper, as owners looking to spend big money on a backstop will be holding out for one of the aforementioned players. If you wait to offer up Doumit until after the players from that group are gone, he'll be seen as the top option, and nervous owners might overbid for him. As long as he can stay healthy, he's a solid, four-category option who will provide good value in all formats. In other words, you won't be far behind anyone if Doumit is your top catcher. 
<p><i>For the Pirates' projected dollar values, <a href= http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/pirates/dollarvalues/>click here.</a></i>
<p><b>Position Battle:</b> Aside from McLouth, no Pirate is guaranteed a starting job in the outfield. For now, it looks like Nyjer Morgan and Brandon Moss have the inside tracks in LF and RF, respectively, but Steve Pearce, Craig Monroe and Eric Hinske also are possibilities. Top prospect Andrew McCutchen (more on him in a second) could also throw his name into the mix with a strong spring. NL-only owners shouldn't invest too heavily in any of the Pirates' outfielders (except McLouth), but there is potential value there. It will come down to grabbing the right guy at the right time. Over the course of the season, it wouldn't be a surprise to see Morgan (because of his speed) and Hinske (because of his versatility) having the most value out of this group.
<p><b>Prospect Watch:</b> Andrew McCutchen is only 22, but he's already had considerable success in the minors. Last season, playing entirely at Triple-A, he hit .283 (.372 OBP) with nine HRs, 75 runs, 50 RBIs and 34 SBs. Those are mighty impressive numbers given his age. Even more impressive is that he increased his BB rate (11.7 percent) and lowered his K rate (17.0). However, there is one sign that he's probably not ready for big league duty -- he was caught stealing 19 times. If McCutchen does make the majors this year, his biggest asset will be his speed, but he obviously still has a lot to learn on the basepaths. Because of that, he likely won't have a major fantasy impact. Sure, he could go on a few hot streaks, but McCutchen is still  at least one year away from providing consistent, mixed-league help. He's a great keeper option, however, and his time should come shortly.
