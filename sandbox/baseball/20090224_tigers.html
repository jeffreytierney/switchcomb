<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Tigers.</i>
<p><b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/tigers/index.html>Tigers team page</a></b><br/>
<b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/tigers/statistics/projections/>Tigers stat projections</a></b>
<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>Despite falling well short of expectations in 2008, the Tigers were relatively quiet this offseason. Apparently, they're comfortable trying to outslug teams every night. 
<p>The biggest offensive addition Detroit made was trading for catcher Gerald Laird to replace Ivan Rodriguez, who was traded in late July last year. In the Tigers' defense, though, they couldn't get much better offensively after scoring 821 runs -- fifth most in the league. Maybe that explains why they settled on Adam Everett, a career .246 hitter, to replace Edgar Renteria at short. 
<p>The real concern for Detroit this offseason was its pitching staff, which posted a 4.90 ERA a year ago. So, to improve the rotation, the Tigers traded OF Matt Joyce to Tampa Bay for Edwin Jackson, who sports a career 5.15 ERA. And to bolster a shaky bullpen, they signed free agent Brandon Lyon, who was last seen taking a demotion from the closer role in Arizona. Mission accomplished. 
<p>The Tigers better hope Justin Verlander can regain his '07 form, Armando Galarraga can avoid a sophomore slump and Dontrelle Willis can remember how to pitch, or else they'll have to lean heavily on their hitters once again. That approach led to a last-place finish in the AL Central a season ago.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>Can Miguel Cabrera put together two solid halves?</b> 
<p>Cabrera put up a solid .292-37-127 line in '08, but his spoiled owners expected a bigger jump in production in his first season with the much-ballyhooed Tigers offense. While his overall numbers might not have been worthy of a top-five pick, you couldn't have asked for much more from Cabrera after the All-Star break. 
<p>Cabrera, who hit .284-16-57 in 348 first-half at-bats, exploded to the tune of .302-21-70 in just 268 at-bats after the break. The biggest difference between the halves was Cabrera's power, as his slugging percentage jumped from .489 to .601. 
<p>Now that he seems to be comfortable in Detroit, owners are wondering if Cabrera can put together two solid halves. His '08 BABIP was .316, well below his career mark of .350, according to Fangraphs.com, which suggests his '08 "struggles" were a fluke. Even with a career-low .316 BABIP, Cabrera turned in strong numbers, so there is a very good chance he can regain his spot among the elite hitters if that number returns closer to .350. 
<p><b>HITTERS</B> 
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Curtis Granderson. The Tigers' leadoff hitter is likely to slide in a few drafts this year because of a disappointing '08 season. It's not that his numbers were bad -- after all, he hit .280-22-66 with 112 runs despite missing most of April with a wrist injury. But it was the drop-off in steals (12, down from 26 in '07) despite an uptick in OBP that left his owners wanting more. One explanation for the decline is that Granderson probably overachieved on the bases in '07; he had just eight steals in 159 games in '06 and only topped 20 in one minor league season. Plus, the Tigers aren't likely to run much while their big boppers are at the plate. Expect more of the same this season and around 15 steals for Granderson. 
<br /><b>Others:</b> Miguel Cabrera, Magglio Ordonez, Placido Polanco.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Carlos Guillen. After missing 49 games last season with back problems, Guillen's fantasy stock is plummeting. Mix in his declining batting average (down last two seasons) and loss of SS eligibility, and Guillen is in danger of becoming AL-only material. He's a below-average 1B/3B/OF option and an injury risk because of that balky back. 
<br /><b>Others:</b> Gary Sheffield.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Jeff Larish. This is admittedly a weak choice, but there aren't many (if any) sleeper options on a roster with proven veterans and no positions up for grabs. Larish could be an option at DH if/when Gary Sheffield gets hurt, or could get a shot at third base if Brandon Inge becomes too much of an offensive liability (and if Guillen stays in the outfield). Larish, who has averaged 22 homers in the last three minor-league seasons, could be a source if cheap power if given an everyday job. But beware of his poor batting average (career .260 in the minors).
<br /><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Going Deeper:</b> Marcus Thames. Thames has mixed-league appeal when he gets on his hot streaks, but his true value lies in AL-only leagues. He'll probably only see about 300 at-bats in a season between OF, DH and 1B, and he can't be counted on to hit above .250. But he makes up for those shortcomings by supplying owners with plenty of power. He's averaged 23 homers in the last three seasons despite limited playing time.

<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B> 
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Armando Galarraga. The rookie turned heads in '08, going 13-7 with a 3.73 ERA and 1.19 WHIP in 178.2 innings. Not bad, but can he build on that success in his second season? Fantasy owners who take a chance on him will want to monitor his splits. Galarraga struggled at home (4.18 ERA, 1.36 WHIP, .265 BAA at home; 3.36/1.06/.193 on road) and at night (4.30/1.24/.230 at night; 2.69/1.10/.218 during the day). If the same holds true this season, fantasy owners should be able to avoid most of the land mines from the start. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Justin Verlander. What happened to Verlander? After an impressive '06 season and a dominant '07 campaign, the flamethrower suddenly "lost it." There has been no report of an injury, but Verlander's velocity last year was down from his usual mid- to upper-90s territory. Owners banking on a bounce-back season will want to monitor his velocity in spring training. If Verlander is still struggling to get his fastball back up around 95, you're better off taking a chance elsewhere. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Jeremy Bonderman, Brandon Lyon, Joel Zumaya.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Dontrelle Willis. Believe it or not, Willis has an outside shot at making the rotation this season. Yes, he has been awful and/or hurt the last two years. But any time you put a former 22-game winner in a rotation backed by one of the league's top offenses, you have serious sleeper potential. Of course, he'll have to cut down on the walks before he has any chance of being effective. Willis isn't worth drafting in mixed leagues, but he's worth monitoring in March and April.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Fernando Rodney.
<p><b>Going Deeper:</b> Edwin Jackson. Jackson was up and down last season with Tampa Bay to say the least. After going 7-2 in July and August, he was pounded for a 7.90 ERA and 1.94 WHIP as opponents hit him at a .385 clip. He's far too erratic to rely on in mixed leagues, but he does have potential to be a back-end fantasy starter in AL-only leagues if he makes the rotation out of spring training.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> Most of the Tigers' pitching staff won't be worth buying in Ultimate Fantasy Baseball, but two names stand out as good values. First, Armando Galarraga ($3.85M) costs less than teammate Justin Verlander ($5M) despite recording far more TSNP/G last season (54.73 to 37). Second, Brandon Lyon will cost you just $2 million and will be one of the cheapest closers out there if he wins the job this spring.

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> There's nothing sexy about Placido Polanco. Well, OK, maybe the ladies like the name, but there's nothing sexy about him in 5x5 leagues. However, he's a nice option in points leagues, thanks to a .306 career average, a .350 career OBP and an unwillingness to strike out -- Polanco has fanned just 100 times in the last <i>three seasons</i> (1,628 at-bats). He won't give you much in terms of home runs or stolen bases, but he should score runs in bunches hitting second in Detroit's lineup. 
<p><b>Position Battle:</b> Fantasy owners will want to pay close attention to Detroit's closer battle this spring. Newcomer Brandon Lyon is the favorite to win the job, but Fernando Rodney and Joel Zumaya are also capable of shutting the door in the ninth. Manager Jim Leyland has already said Zumaya will not be auditioning for the closer role this spring, so it appears to be a fight between Lyon and Rodney. Because Lyon has proved to be unreliable and neither Rodney nor Zumaya has thrived in the ninth inning, expect the Tigers to play musical chairs with their stoppers this season. 
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> The uncertainty at closer will have one of two effects on auctions this spring. Either people will be willing to pay $7-8 each for Lyon, Rodney and Zumaya in hopes that their pick will emerge as the closer, or people will avoid the situation, leaving a chance to get cheap saves. One way to find out will be to nominate the underdog Zumaya first to set the market. If he goes above what you're willing to pay for a shaky closer like Lyon, the favorite to win the job, then start focusing your attention and dollars elsewhere. Worst-case scenario, you come away with a high-K guy with closer potential for a buck. 
<p><i>For the Tigers' projected dollar values, <a href= http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/tigers/dollarvalues/>click here.</a></i>
<p><b>Ballpark factor:</b> Comerica Park checks in at No. 3 in our <a href= http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/ballparks/index.html>Ballpark Power Index</a> after ranking among the top five stadiums in home runs, runs and slugging percentage in '08. That's terrible news for owners hoping Justin Verlander can rebound, Armando Galarraga can avoid a sophomore slump, or any other Tigers pitcher can post respectable numbers. Beware of taking any risks on Tigers pitchers, but their hitters are in a great environment.
