<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Cardinals.</i>

<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>It won't take long to catch up on the Cardinals' offseason additions. There has been only one of any significance -- the trade for shortstop Khalil Greene. To be fair, the team did re-sign starter Kyle Lohse to a four-year deal before free agency started, but for the most part, St. Louis is sitting tight and hoping in-house options will take care of its pitching and infield needs. 
<P>If Chris Carpenter is healthy -- and most important, remains that way throughout the season -- the rotation should be in good shape. The team blew 31 saves last year, so establishing a closer and quickly settling the other relievers into their roles will be an early-season priority. Ideally, Chris Perez would prove that he can handle the role. If not, look for a committee approach, possibly headed by Ryan Franklin, until Perez (or Jason Motte) is ready. And at second base? Well, that's the big question mark.

<!-- /who's here -->
<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>Who's at second?</b>
<p>It could be a career minor leaguer (Joe Thurston), a youngish utility player (Brendan Ryan) or a converted outfielder (Skip Schumaker). Manager Tony La Russa seems to be hoping the best bat (Schumaker) wins the job, or at least shows well enough on the infield to platoon. That, in turn, would open a starting outfield spot for a healthy Chris Duncan or highly touted prospect Colby Rasmus. If Schumaker is a defensive flop at second, though, the outfield will remain crowded and the team's second baseman will remain a light hitter who deserves to bat behind the pitcher, which is exactly where La Russa would slot whomever that is. 
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Albert Pujols. Rumor is that Pujols guy can swing the bat. After eight major league seasons, he has won two MVPs (and probably should have won two or three more). And he's still in his prime. El Hombre is a .334 career hitter whose "worst" year was 2007 when he hit only 32 homers with 103 RBIs and 99 runs. Pujols underwent elbow surgery last fall, so check on him right before draft day to make sure his arm is still attached. And assuming it is, he'll be one of the surest things in fantasy baseball.  
<br/><b>Others:</b> Rick Ankiel.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Ryan Ludwick. Despite first cracking the majors in '02, Ludwick never stuck around long enough to make a mark till the Cards gave him a shot in '07. He responded with 14 homers in 303 at-bats, and followed that with a 37-homer, 113-RBI All-Star campaign. The question on everyone's mind: Is this 30-year-old a late bloomer or just a flash in the pan? Most owners seem skeptical, and I certainly wouldn't advocate banking on a complete repeat. That said, another 30-homer season is certainly within his grasp. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Troy Glaus.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Khalil Greene. How does a shortstop go from hitting 27 homers (albeit with a .254 average) to batting .213 and generally looking lost at the plate? Blame the '07 homer total, which seemed to have Greene swinging for the fences too much last season. That's not an ideal strategy for a middle infielder in San Diego. There's always the hopeful talk about a "change of scenery" doing a player good, but you'll realize there's more than talk here when you look at Greene's career home/road splits (.225/.270). Busch Stadium is by no stretch a hitter's park, but just about anything is better than Petco.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Skip Schumaker.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Chris Duncan. Given the '08 breakouts from Ludwick and Ankiel and all of the attention directed at Rasmus, it's easy to forget about Duncan. That's a mistake, and even La Russa has said so. Duncan hit 43 homers over his first two seasons before a herniated disc in his neck sapped his power last year and put his career in doubt. He underwent surgery to replace the disc with a titanium one, the first such procedure on a professional athlete. While that might give some owners pause, you have to admit it's pretty cool; he has a Robo-neck. If things go his way -- certainly no guarantees there -- Duncan will be a cheap power find for NL-only owners.

</table>
<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Adam Wainwright. Here's a top-15 starter who'll come a little cheaper after making only 20 starts last year because of injury. Don't be scared off, though. It was a finger -- not an elbow or shoulder -- that sidelined him. He's fine now, and he has the arsenal and command to post an ERA in the low 3s and WHIP below 1.20. 
<br/><b>Others: None.</b> 
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Todd Wellemeyer. He was a fantastic early-season grab for me last year in a K-heavy points league and his RP eligibility was a bonus, so it hurts me to put him here. But call me cautious with pitchers who see more than a 100-inning increase from one season to the next. Wellemeyer was able to pitch 191.2 innings last year, but can he do it again?
<br/><b>Others:</b> Chris Carpenter.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Chris Perez. The uncertainty in the Cardinals' bullpen prevents owners from valuing any St. Louis reliever among the top 25 RP options, for now. Even if the team starts April with a committee approach, as long as one of the relievers steps forward before June as "the guy," he should finish the year among the top 20 closers. Perez won't simply be handed the role, but he's the odds-on favorite.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Jason Motte.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Kyle Lohse isn't a bad pitcher, and your league mates won't laugh at you if you take him in the final rounds of your mixed league. Just recognize that the odds of him matching last season's 15 wins and 3.78 ERA aren't great. SN's <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/cardinals/statistics/projections/>projection</a> of 12 wins and a 4.25 ERA is closer to what you should expect.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> By my count, there are 141 pitchers in SN's Salary Cap Baseball who cost more than Chris Carpenter ($1.75 M). I can't even begin to explain the ridiculousness. (Here's a taste: Unemployed pitchers like Odalis Perez and Curt Schilling cost more.) Yes, Carp's a sizable injury risk after missing nearly all of the past two seasons because of Tommy John surgery and nerve issues in his shoulder. But when healthy, he's among the very best in the game. (He won the Cy Young in '05 and was third in '06.) The salary cap format is the ideal place to gamble on a high-upside pick like that, especially when he costs almost nothing.

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> Rick Ankiel hit 20 homers in the first half last season before an abdominal injury/sports hernia limited him in the final two months. But owners in leagues that penalize strikeouts will note that Ks are no longer this former pitcher's friend. He struck out 100 times in 413 at-bats in '08. Keep in mind that he has seen barely more than a full season's worth of major league at-bats (672), and that figure counts his hacks as a pitcher. 
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> I listed Troy Glaus under the "buyer beware" category above, but there's also the possibility to find auction value here. Reports on his recovery from shoulder surgery have been positive, and it's possible he'll be back on the field by mid-April. Given that most owners were expecting a lengthier absence, and their rankings/dollar values likely reflect that, Glaus could outperform his price.

<p><b>Position Battle:</b> All the attention is on second, but I'm telling you: The Cardinals will do everything they can to make the Schumaker/Ryan platoon work. So let's look at who'll fill in for Glaus to open the year. When the injury news broke, conventional wisdom hinted the team would look to the minors -- Triple-A's David Freese (acquired in the Jim Edmonds deal) or Double-A's Brett Wallace ('08 first-round pick). But if there are two rules about La Russa, they're: No. 1 he prefers veterans; and No. 2 he seems to think a real ballplayer can play anywhere. With those points in mind, look for another outfielder conversion -- Joe Mather -- to get the opening day start at third, before shifting to backup duty when Glaus is healthy. Mather is not a bad $1 grab for NL-only owners.
<p><b>Prospect Watch:</B> Baltimore's Matt Wieters and Tampa Bay's David Price are the only prospects ranked ahead of outfielder Colby Rasmus in Baseball America's 2009 prospect rankings. Rasmus shouldn't receive quite the auction-day hype as those other two, so you can probably get him at a good price. Keep in mind, though, that he's just 22, and the Cardinals won't rush him if he shows this spring that he's still not ready. The team certainly has the outfield depth to get by.
