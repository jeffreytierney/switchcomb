<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Indians.</i>
<p><b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/indians/index.html>Indians team page</a></b><br/>
<b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/indians/statistics/projections/>Indians stat projections</a></b>
<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>The Indians had five different pitchers save games for them last season, and this was for a team that finished 27th in the majors with 31 saves. From Joe Borowski to Rafael Betancourt to Masa Kobayashi -- and even with some spot duty by lefty setup man Rafael Perez thrown in -- the Indians couldn't settle on a closer until Jensen Lewis took over late in the year.
<p>Then, even after Lewis converted 13 of 14 save opportunities, the Indians still went out and signed Kerry Wood to a two-year, $20.5 million deal this offseason. Wood converted 34 of 40 save opportunities with the Cubs in one of the few years he has been healthy, though he still managed to spend some time on the DL because of a blister. If Wood pitches like he did last year (84 Ks in 66.1 IP), he'll be worth it for the Indians and fantasy leaguers. But he's still a big health risk and is better suited as a No. 2 closer.
<p>Earlier in the offseason, the Indians traded three minor league pitchers to the Cubs for infielder/outfielder Mark DeRosa. Cleveland will slot DeRosa at third base and keep Asdrubal Cabrera at second. Meanwhile, a 12-player trade with Seattle and the Mets might have landed the Indians their second baseman of the future in Luis Valbuena.
<p>Overall, the Indians' 2008 season was a big disappointment and it culminated with the team trading pitching stalwart CC Sabathia. Perhaps the only thing that saved the Indians from more ridicule was having Detroit in the same division. But a curious thing happened down the stretch when the Indians started to play better, and they actually built a little momentum entering 2009.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>Can Travis Hafner and Victor Martinez bounce back from injuries?</b> 
<p>The Indians got a combined 130 games from these two players in '08, and not having them in the middle of the lineup took some of the scare factor out of facing Cleveland. Martinez had elbow surgery and returned in late August. The fact he hit .288 in September lends hope to the idea that he can return to his previous dominance. He's a somewhat sneaky option at catcher who can be drafted a little later than the players who are considered elite.
<p>Hafner is another story. He was somewhat disappointing in '07 after posting ridiculous numbers in '06, and in '08 he went into all-out free-fall mode because of shoulder problems that eventually led to surgery. Hafner is finally taking batting practice, and in the latest reports it appeared as though he would be delayed in starting exhibition games this spring. Hafner is a big risk-reward pick, and because he clogs up a valuable utility spot, it's best to avoid him.
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Grady Sizemore. Sizemore's batting average dropped to a four-year low of .268 in '08, but that hasn't stopped him from moving up draft boards. He's No. 6 on our Top 300 list, but we've seen him go as early as fifth in some drafts. That's because Sizemore set career highs in home runs (33), RBIs (90) and stolen bases (38) last year. That type of production makes him unique and worthy of such attention. There aren't many guys who are legitimate 35/40 threats.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Victor Martinez.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Asdrubal Cabrera. Cabrera was a nice waiver-wire find last season when he hit .416 with 22 RBIs and 15 runs scored in September. But don't expect that performance to carry over into this season. Cabrera hasn't been nearly that consistent during the rest of his brief career. Plus, he could get competition from newly acquired Luis Valbuena at second base. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Mark DeRosa, Ryan Garko, Travis Hafner.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Shin-Soo Choo. Choo was on fire after the All-Star break in '08 when he hit .343 with 11 home runs and 48 RBIs. While we shouldn't expect those numbers to continue over an entire season, that performance should give him a leg up in landing a starting role. Choo hit .420 in the sixth spot last year, which is where we have him slotted this season. He can round out your mixed-league outfield.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Ben Francisco. Francisco's 15 homers last season didn't go unnoticed in AL-only leagues. However, he hit just .236 with 19 RBIs after the break. That type of fade might have opened him up for a quick hook should the struggles continue. Eventually, Francisco could be replaced by Matt LaPorta, but for now he can be used to fill out your AL-only league outfield.

<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Cliff Lee. He was on the scrap heap at this time last season, but now his picture is in every fantasy guidebook next to the obligatory paragraph on why you should wait to draft pitching. However, with a Cy Young on Lee's mantle the pendulum might swing in the other direction. How much are you willing to pay for a pitcher who is coming off a career year? If our <a href= http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/mock_draft/1_12.html >latest mock draft</a> is any indication, owners still aren't buying into Lee as a true ace; he was taken in the seventh round. At that price, it's worth it to see if Lee can keep the magic going.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Carl Pavano. Quick word association game: You say Carl Pavano. I say buttocks. Yep it always comes back to the buttocks injury Pavano suffered in '06 that made writing injury updates here at Fantasy Source so much fun. Seriously, though, Pavano had a laundry list of injuries after that, including Tommy John surgery, and was unreliable after he left Florida in 2004 as an 18-game winner and signed a four-year, $39.5 million deal with the Yankees. He went 9-8 in those four seasons in New York. Pavano needs to prove he's back before fantasy owners take a chance on him.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Fausto Carmona, Kerry Wood.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Scott Lewis. Lewis will have to fight Aaron Laffey, Zach Jackson, Jeremy Sowers, Anthony Reyes and Pavano for a rotation spot, but we're betting he ends up in the No. 5 role at the end of spring training. Lewis impressed fantasy owners in a September '08 call-up by going 4-0 with a 2.63 ERA and 1.08 WHIP in four starts. However, Lewis needs to prove he can stay healthy before mixed leaguers make a serious play.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Anthony Reyes.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Jensen Lewis. The Indians' other Lewis was penciled in as the team's closer until Kerry Wood came along. But with Wood's injury history, it's worth keeping Lewis in mind. He converted 13 of 14 save opportunities last year and despite having early control problems seemed to really take to the role. Of course, the Indians had been grooming Lewis as their closer of the future. Now, he'll be a setup man, but things can change in a hurry.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b>
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> Fausto Carmona ($5.15 million) would be a bargain if he could regain his '07 form (19-8. 3.06 ERA, 1.21 WHIP). But he regressed last season (8-7, 5.44 ERA, 1.62 WHIP) in part because of a hip injury and still doesn't strike out many batters. That makes Carmona a "risk-reward" pick entering '09, and to be honest there are safer bets who are comparably priced in our game in Minnesota's Francisco Liriano ($5.25M) and Kansas City's Zack Greinke ($5.2M).

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> Rotisserie leaguers will complain that Jhonny Peralta doesn't provide enough steals, but his extra-base hits more than make up for it in points leagues. Peralta ranked third among shortstops last season with 23 home runs, and his points-league value was surpassed only by those of Hanley Ramirez and Jose Reyes, according to the <a href= http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/statistics/sortableStatsShell.html?sortCategory=Avg&duration=365&year=2008&league=undefined&position=SS&page=1>sortable stats pages</a> on Fantasy Source.
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> Mark DeRosa set career highs in home runs, RBIs, runs and steals in '08 while with the Cubs. As a result, he will be overvalued in auction leagues. At $15, the Indians' new third baseman will cost the same as Texas' Chris Davis, who is a more powerful hitter with more upside. DeRosa does have position versatility going for him, but you'll be better off taking a chance on Robinson Cano ($14) at second base or Eric Byrnes ($14) in the outfield.

<p><b>Position Battle:</b> The Indians have an embarrassment of riches at catcher with Victor Martinez and Kelly Shoppach. So the team is toying with the idea of playing Martinez some at first base in order to get both players in the lineup. Plus, it wouldn't hurt for Martinez to save some wear and tear after missing 89 games last season with hamstring and elbow injuries. Moving Martinez into a part-time role at first will likely cut into Ryan Garko's playing time, provided DH Travis Hafner stays healthy.   
<p><b>Prospect Watch:</b> Matt LaPorta was the key piece for the Indians in the CC Sabathia trade, but LaPorta is likely to spend '09 in Triple-A. He projects as a righthanded power bat; LaPorta's .539 slugging percentage was seventh among Double-A players in '08. However, according to <i>Baseball America</i>, he has a couple of holes in his swing and needs an opportunity to work those out in the minors. LaPorta is someone for fantasy owners to keep in mind if an injury or two hits the Indians in the outfield or at first base. He could provide power in a pinch.
