<p><b><li><a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/rankings/of/>Complete OF rankings</a></b>
<p>With home runs declining around the league, an influx of power-speed combo players is emerging in the outfield. That group is headlined by fantasy stalwarts Matt Holliday, who flirted with 30-30 in 2008, and Grady Sizemore, who came close to a 30-40 campaign. 
<p>You'll need a lofty first-round pick to land those stars, which means you're passing up premium talent at thinner positions in order to stack your outfield. 
<p>If you're not OK with that approach, try targeting groups of more affordable outfielders who have 20-20 potential to go along with solid runs and RBIs. Not only will it build a balanced outfield, but this strategy also helps you avoid having to draft a one-trick pony like Juan Pierre. 
<p><b>Rounds 1-3</b><br />
With Holliday and Sizemore off the board, the next combo players to target include Ryan Braun (37 home runs and 14 steals in 2008), Carlos Beltran (27, 25), Alfonso Soriano (29, 19) and Nate McLouth (26, 23). 
<p><b>Rounds 4-7</b><br />
Even if you only nabbed one of the previously mentioned 20-20 hitters already, there should be plenty more talent left in these rounds. Check out Matt Kemp (18, 35), Nick Markakis (20, 10), Shane Victorino (14, 36), Bobby Abreu (20, 22), B.J. Upton (9, 44), Alex Rios (15, 32), Curtis Granderson (22, 12) and Torii Hunter (21, 19). 
<p><b>Rounds 8-12</b><br />
We're getting thin, but there still is solid 20-20 potential here. Corey Hart (20, 23), Jayson Werth (24, 20), Johnny Damon (17, 29) and Chris Young (22, 14) could all be in this range. 
<p><b>Later rounds</b><br />
Still looking for power and speed? You can take Mike Cameron (25, 17) and his horrible batting average. Or you can go with the upside of Washington teammates Lastings Milledge (14, 24) and Elijah Dukes (13, 13). That should round out your championship outfield. 
<p><b>3 UP</b>
<p><b>1. Carlos Quentin, White Sox.</b> Quentin went from bust to breakout player in his first season with the White Sox. Don't worry about him being a one-year wonder. Quentin was a highly touted prospect while with the Diamondbacks, so his impressive numbers were somewhat expected. 
<p><b>2. Nate McLouth, Pirates.</b> McLouth came out of nowhere to smack 26 dingers and swipe 23 bags last year. Fantasy owners love the combination of power and speed. Even if the homers aren't there in 2009, McLouth will have the runs and steals to keep his value high. 
<p><b>3. Andre Ethier, Dodgers.</b> With an everyday job all but locked up for 2009, Ethier should be able to improve on his successful '08 campaign. Expect good power numbers to go with a solid average. 
<p><b>3 DOWN</b>
<p><b>1. Vladimir Guerrero, Angels.</b> It hurts to write this, but Vlad is declining. His creaky knees are costing him more and more games, and the power numbers have been declining the past few seasons. He's still a great fantasy option, but no longer elite. 
<p><b>2. Jeremy Hermida, Marlins.</b> Tired of waiting for Hermida to break out? So are we. The Marlins might be, too. After struggling in the second half, Hermida lost his starting job and will have to regain the trust of both the Marlins' brass and fantasy owners. 
<p><b>3. Ken Griffey Jr., White Sox.</b> Griffey's power numbers dropped sharply in 2008 despite being healthy for most of the season. Even his average is starting to slip. It has been a great ride for the future Hall of Famer, but one that's coming to an end. 
<p><b>AUCTION STRATEGY</b>
<p>With so many high-quality fantasy options at the position, you don't have to spend top dollar on a five-category player like Matt Holliday. Why not spread those dollars around and grab three or four value-priced stars that contribute across the board? Try to assemble a combination of versatile outfielders like Alex Rios, Curtis Granderson, Corey Hart and Hunter Pence. You'll save a few bucks and rack up fantasy points. 
<p><b>AVERAGE JOE</b>
<P> <table cellpadding=3 cellspacing=1 border=0 width=100% bgcolor=CCCCCC class=v11>
<tr bgcolor="#000000" style="color: #FFFFFF;"><td align=left> <B> POSITION </td><td align=left> <B> AVERAGE </td><td align=left> <B> RUNS </td><td align=left> <B> HRs </td><td align=left> <B> RBIs </td><td align=left> <B> SBs </td> </tr>
<tr bgcolor="FFFFFF" valign=top><td align=left> OF </td><td align=left> .276 </td><td align=left> 78 </td><td align=left> 19 </td><td align=left> 73 </td><td align=left> 13 </td></tr>
</table>
<font class=text>
<p><b>David Murphy, Rangers.</b> Murphy hit .275 with 15 home runs, 73 RBIs, 64 runs and seven steals in just 415 at-bats last year. Had he played a full season, his numbers would be closer to the mixed-league outfielder averages shown above. He has above-average RBI potential, but guys like Murphy are a dime a dozen in the late middle rounds, so you can wait to fill your final few outfield slots.
<p><b>SLEEPERS</b>
<p>Looking for this year's Ryan Ludwick? One of the names you'll want to target on draft day is Philadelphia's Jayson Werth. Although he was a part-time player for much of 2008, Werth was one of seven outfielders to turn in a 20-20 season -- and he did it in just 418 at-bats. He'll have a full-time job heading into '09 and will give fantasy owners that all-important power-speed combo. 
<p>Another versatile player to target is 28-year-old rookie Nelson Cruz, who will be fighting for a spot in the Rangers' outfield. Cruz has legit power and speed, as proved by his 37 jacks and 24 steals in 383 Triple-A at-bats last season. Plus, he'll be hitting in Texas' potent lineup, which always is a good thing. 
<p>If you miss out on Werth and Cruz, don't panic. Elijah Dukes is poised for a breakout season now that he has a job for the Nationals. He has 20-20 potential, and if Dukes can stay out of trouble, he could be late-round gold. In the AL, check out Shin-Soo Choo. He was outstanding for Cleveland in the final two months of 2008 (.359-10-41 with 41 runs) and likely earned an everyday job for '09. 
<p><b>MEDICAL REPORT</b>
<p>Eric Byrnes was limited to 52 games because of hamstring injuries last season, including what he called a 98-percent tear of his left hamstring. Byrnes' value hinges on his speed, so keep an eye on how well/often he runs in spring training.
<p>Josh Willingham, who has a history of back problems, missed 60 games last year with lower back pain. He'll likely see time at first base, but it's his swing, not playing the outfield, that keeps his back hurting. 
<p>A healthy Jerry Hairston Jr. could have pieced together a breakout 2008 season, but he landed on the disabled list three times with a fractured thumb and a repeated hamstring strain. If he could stay healthy, Hairston might find a permanent spot in the Reds' lineup and produce stellar steals and runs totals. 
<p>The oft-injured J.D. Drew was healthy for consecutive seasons before back problems limited him to just 109 games last year. You'll enjoy Drew's production when healthy, but be warned that he has averaged just 121 games played in the past nine seasons.
<p>Hideki Matsui, who underwent knee surgery last September, is expected to see more time at DH this season than in left field. That should keep his knee healthy, but the 34-year-old veteran should be considered an injury risk on the decline. 
<p><b>ONE-TRICK PONIES</b>
<p>If you need to fill a few statistical holes in your outfield, the following specialists (whose statistics below are from last season) can help in their areas of expertise. Just know they aren't likely to help you anywhere else.

<p><b>GET TO KNOW...</b>
<p>We have already gotten a glimpse of what these youngsters can do in limited big-league action, but chances are we'll see more out of them in 2009: 
<p><b>Cameron Maybin, Marlins.</b> Maybin, who will be 22 this season, is still raw, but he has all the tools to be a fantasy superstar in the future. He hit .297 in three minor league seasons (1,093 at-bats), while averaging 12 home runs and 24 stolen bases per season. Think he's too young to contribute in '09? He hit .500 in a brief stint with Florida to close out '08 and enters this year as the favorite to win the starting center field job. 
<p><b>Steve Pearce, Pirates.</b> Pearce has to battle for playing time in a crowded Pirates outfield, but he's worth a flier on draft day. He has the potential to hit for a high average, having batted .320 or better in three different minor league stops in 2007. Pearce also averaged 23 home runs in the minors from 2006-08 and has decent speed to contribute a few steals. Think of him as a cheaper version of Jay Bruce. 
<p><b>Josh Anderson, Braves.</b> Anderson, 26, could be a great source of steals if he wins the starting center field job out of spring training. The speedster never stole fewer than 26 bags at any stop in the minors and averaged 44 swipes in the past four seasons. If he locks in at the top of the Braves' lineup, you can expect a lot of runs to go along with those thefts.
