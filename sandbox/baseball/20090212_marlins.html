<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Marlins.</i>

<b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/marlins/statistics/projections/>Marlins stat projections</a></b>
<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>It was another busy offseason of cost-cutting for the frugal Marlins. Players due for big raises in arbitration -- Kevin Gregg, Mike Jacobs, Scott Olsen and Josh Willingham -- were quickly jettisoned to other teams, and only a couple major-league ready players were brought in. 
<p>That doesn't mean the Marlins don't have talent. Last year's club finished 84-77, good for third in the NL East. Hanley Ramirez, Dan Uggla, Ricky Nolasco and Josh Johnson make up a solid corps to build around, and budding prospects such as Cameron Maybin, Chris Volstad and Matt Lindstrom give the team even more hope for the future. However, the Marlins will likely have to hit it big on a few rookies (Gaby Sanchez?) or low-cost veterans (like Jorge Cantu last season) to truly contend this year. 
<p>Even if this team finishes around .500 again, several Florida players could help decide fantasy championships. Sure, it would be nice if there was more protection in the lineup for Uggla or relief in the bullpen for Nolasco, as these types of players could probably post even better stats with some help. But, as it is, let the lack of protection/relief serve as a warning: Don't overpay for any Florida player not named Hanley. 
<P>I guess we can all take a cue from the Marlins' front office on that one.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>Can Florida's young pitchers stay healthy?</b> 
<P>All but one of Florida's projected starting pitchers has had major injury problems in the past two years. Josh Johnson had Tommy John surgery in August of '07, and Anibal Sanchez had surgery to repair a torn labrum a month before that. Andrew Miller missed more than six weeks in '08 because of a knee injury, and Ricky Nolasco missed most of '07 because of a sore elbow. Nolasco is an even bigger injury risk heading into this year because of the 212.1 innings he threw last season -- more than 50 above his previous professional high.
<p>Obviously, there are inherent risks with any of these pitchers. Fantasy owners should be careful not to overdraft. There's a lot of talent here, but the risk of injury cannot be ignored. Johnson looks to be the "safest," which sounds crazy since he's only pitched 103 innings since 2006. Unfortunately, that's the way it goes for a team that depends on young pitching.
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Hanley Ramirez. Ramirez will go in the top four of virtually every draft this year, and he has the top ADP (1.32) over at Mock Draft Central. You know what you're getting with Ramirez -- a five-category producer with 30-30 (maybe even 40-40) potential from a shallow position. What's not to like? Owners shouldn't get too carried away <a href=http://www.sportingnews.com/blog/FantasySourceFastball/183610/> with their projections</a>, but the 25-year-old Ramirez still has room to improve. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Dan Uggla, Jorge Cantu.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Cameron Maybin. Maybin caused a stir in September when he hit .500 with nine runs and four stolen bases in eight games for the Marlins. Owners were already high on the 21-year-old's potential, but this sent the hype-machine into overdrive. But there are concerns with Maybin, most notably that he's never played a game at Triple-A. Also, he struck out 31.8 percent of the time at Double-A last season, and he only hit .277. Maybin is expected to win the Marlins' CF job, but it wouldn't be a shock to see him begin the year in Triple-A for a little more seasoning. Even if starts from Day 1, he will probably be inconsistent. He has 15/30 potential as a rookie, but he also has the potential to hit .230.
<br/><b>Others:</b>  Dallas McPherson.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Cody Ross. Before last season, Ross was seen as little more than a righty platoon player. He received extensive playing time in '08 and responded by hitting .260 with 22 HRs and 73 RBIs. While he fared better against lefties (.285/.342/.569 compared to .249/.305/.451 vs. righties), his power stroke showed no discrimination (10 HRs vs. lefties, 12 HRs vs. righties). With Josh Willingham gone, Ross is expected to have a starting job. It's tough to imagine the 28-year-old doing much better this year, but NL-only owners (and deep mixed-league owners) won't complain about 20-plus HRs from a late-round pick.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Jeremy Hermida.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Right now, the Marlins plan on using Jorge Cantu at first base and either Wes Helms or Dallas McPherson at third base, but that could change if <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/rankings/prospects/>highly touted prospect</a> Gaby Sanchez has a good spring. The big first baseman hit .317 with 17 HRs in 133 games at Double-A last year, and many believe he's ready to make the jump to the majors without playing a game at Triple-A. That's always a risky move, and Sanchez will likely see some time at Triple-A, but he might not stay down long. Sanchez should have an impact at some point this year, so fantasy owners should be watching the wire.

</table>
<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B> 
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Ricky Nolasco. We've already talked about why Nolasco is an injury risk, but he still has plenty of fantasy value. In fact, his numbers indicate that he's a borderline ace. He was one of only eight SPs with a WHIP under 1.20 and more than 180 Ks last season. Perhaps most impressive about Nolasco was his consistency. Aside from a rocky April, he kept his ERA under 3.98 and K/9 ratio above 6.60 in every month. Sure, '08 might have been a career year, but Nolasco looks like he can be a four-category contributor for several seasons.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Josh Johnson, Matt Lindstrom.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Andrew Miller. We've been hearing about this kid's talent since his college days at North Carolina, but Miller has failed to show any semblance of consistency. His strong May (2.43 ERA, 1.08 WHIP, 28 Ks in 29.2 innings) showed us what he's capable of, but we need more than mere flashes before we trust him on a mixed-league roster. Even if he has a hot start, owners should be cautious.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Anibal Sanchez.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Chris Volstad. Volstad was a regular in the Marlins' rotation after his July 6 call-up, and he didn't disappoint, posting a 2.88 ERA and 1.33 WHIP in 15 appearances. His K/9 ratio isn't great (5.55 -- consistent with his minor league totals), but Volstad will likely improve his BB/9 ratio this season (3.84, more than a full walk per nine above his minor league average). That will lower his WHIP, which will make him even more effective as a fantasy producer. Florida has been careful with his workload in the minors, so Volstad could easily throw more than 190 innings this year without risk of injury. All that adds up to a great late-round sleeper option.
<br/><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Ryan Tucker was downright awful in his 13 appearances with the Marlins last year (8.27 ERA, 1.86 WHIP), but he's still considered one of the top pitching prospects in the organization thanks to his overpowering fastball and "bulldog mentality." If the 22-year-old righty doesn't open the season in the bullpen, he'll likely continue being groomed as a starter in Triple-A. With all the injury risks in the Marlins' rotation, Tucker, who had a 1.58 ERA in 91 innings at Double-A in '08, could be starting for the big club by the All-Star break.

<font class=text>	
<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> Matt Lindstrom only has about a month of closing experience, but he has all the makings of a solid ninth-inning stopper. He's priced at $2.5M in SN's Ultimate Salary Cap game, which makes him the fifth-cheapest closer available. If he can produce like he did in during his closing stint in September last year (5-for-5 on saves, 1.74 ERA, 0.97 WHIP, six Ks in 10.1 innings), he'll be a major bargain.

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> Jorge Cantu ranked 25th in total bases (302) last year, which is gold in points leagues. However, his OBP (.327) and BB:K ratio (0.36) both left something to be desired. Points leaguers need to take all these factors into account when making a decision on Cantu. Don't undervalue him because of his OBP or BB:K ratio, but don't overvalue him based on his ability to slug homers and doubles with ease.
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> Because of his low batting average and inability to steal bases, Dan Uggla isn't a "top-tier" 2B, but his power and run production are as good as anyone at the position. This makes him quite valuable, especially if you can get him at a reduced rate. A good way to get a bargain is nominate him early in the auction process. Other owners will be holding out for Chase Utley or Ian Kinsler and likely won't bid as much on Uggla. If you're planning on spending a lot on your pitching staff or on speed at other positions, targeting Uggla early is an effective way to add power for a cheaper price.

<p><b>Position Battle:</b> When you have one player who hit 42 home runs at Triple-A last season and another who's hit 68 home runs in his entire 10-year major league career, you wouldn't think there would be much of a "battle," but that's the situation the Marlins will be facing for their third base job this spring. Dallas McPherson, once a top prospect with the Angels, has never been able to stay healthy or produce at the major league level despite an impressive track record in the minors. Wes Helms provides no real offensive value, but he's one of those "veteran hitters" you always hear managers talk about. If the 28-year-old McPherson wins the job, he has legit sleeper value because of his power, but fantasy owners shouldn't get too excited. After all, Jorge Cantu resurrected his career at third base for the Marlins last season -- what are the odds of lighting striking in the same place two years in a row?
<p><b>Prospect Watch:</B> You probably didn't notice the Marlins acquired infielder Emilio Bonifacio in the Scott Olsen trade with the Nationals this offseason. He doesn't have much power (10 career minor league home runs), but he has plenty of speed (123 SBs). At 23, Bonifacio still is raw, but he has the potential to be a nice source of steals and runs given regular playing time. Obviously, both the Marlins' 2B and SS jobs are taken, but there's been talk of moving Bonifacio to one of the corner outfield spots. He might even challenge Cody Ross for the left field job in spring training.
