<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the White Sox.</i>

<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>Chicago's offseason is more notable for its departures than its arrivals. Five mixed-league regulars -- Orlando Cabrera, Joe Crede, Ken Griffey Jr., Nick Swisher and Javier Vazquez -- left the South Side, and they've been replaced by, well, that's where the fun comes in. The White Sox won the division last year because of breakout performances by their youngsters. To repeat, they'll need a few more of those players to step forward. 
<P>One of those 2008 stars, Cuban second baseman Alexei Ramirez, will shift to shortstop, which leaves a battle between Chris Getz, Brent Lillibridge and Jayson Nix for Ramirez's former position. In center, Jerry Owens enters the spring as a slight favorite over Brian Anderson and Dewayne Wise. Josh Fields and newcomer Wilson Betemit will wrangle over third base, but they might just be holding the job until another Cuban, 19-year-old Dayan Viciedo, is ready. And to fill Vazquez's rotation spot, the Sox are hoping Bartolo Colon can resurrect his career. If he doesn't, the team has a plethora of young pitchers who will get a chance to show they're ready for the bigs.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>How real were those 2008 breakouts?</b> 
<P>Before last year, Carlos Quentin had hit .230 in parts of two seasons in the majors, and Ramirez's baseball experience in the U.S. consisted of a couple World Baseball Classic games. John Danks was coming off a 6-13 rookie year in which he posted a 5.50 ERA, and Gavin Floyd's '07 wasn't much better (1-5 with a 5.27 ERA in 16 games.) Yet, seemingly overnight, all four turned into top fantasy contributors. Now owners are wondering how much they can trust those breakthroughs. Stay confident in the hitters; they're elite options at their positions now. Meanwhile, although the pitchers could come through again, you shouldn't be surprised if they experience a minor regression instead. Danks slumped a tad after the break (4.26 ERA, .263 BAA), and Floyd still gives up a few too many homers (30 in 206.1 innings).
<p><b>HITTERS</B> 
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Alexei Ramirez. At 180 pounds, Ramirez doesn't have the typical frame of a power hitter. But as he showed with 21 homers in 480 at-bats last year, he clearly has the pop. This guy doesn't go to the plate to take walks, but he's no swing-and-miss artist, either (a 61:18 K/BB ratio last year). With a full season of plate appearances, including half at the homer-friendly U.S. Cellular Field, this 27-year-old has the potential to approach 30 homers.   
<br/><b>Others:</b> Carlos Quentin
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Jim Thome. You could arguably put any of the other Sox power hitters here. Paul Konerko, 33, is coming off his worst season since '03 (.240-22-62), and he was especially abysmal in the first half (.217-9-34). Jermaine Dye, 35, hit .250 on the road last year, although the plus side is he hit .336 at home and totaled 34 homers. But if forced to pick one hitter to approach with caution, it'd have to be Thome, the 38-year-old thumper with a chronically cranky back whose batting average sank 30 points last year.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Konerko, Dye
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Jerry Owens. He stole 32 bases in 93 games in '07, but he did it with a .324 on-base percentage. That's obviously not ideal for a leadoff man, so he must show signs of improvement before you can mark him down as a certain steals sleeper. Dewayne Wise and Brian Anderson also will be pushing hard for the starting job in center, but neither of them provides as much intrigue for fantasy owners.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Josh Fields
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Chris Getz. Some people think Chris Getz can be a poor man's Dustin Pedroia. But before you go writing him into your '09 lineup, realize that Ozzie Guillen has said second base is a completely open competition. That means Lillibridge, who was acquired from Atlanta in the Vazquez trade, could just as easily be the one AL-only owners target, even though he's coming off a horribly disappointing year at Triple-A.

</table>
<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B> 
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Bobby Jenks. I'll lay off the fat jokes, because although Jenks doesn't have an "athlete's body," his performance in his four major league seasons has been consistently strong. He posted his best ERA (2.63) and a healthy WHIP (1.11) last season, but it also came with a much lower strikeout rate (38 in 61.2 innings). Still, in a year with a good deal of closer uncertainty, this guy is a lock for 30-plus saves.  
<br/><b>Others:</b> John Danks, Gavin Floyd
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Bartolo Colon. I'll again hold back on the fat jokes, because frankly, it's not nice to poke fun at a washed-up, former Cy Young winner. Colon consumed massive quantities of innings in his earlier years, and he has paid the price, being mostly useless the past three years. Depending on how well he pitches this spring, Colon might be worth a $1 gamble in a moderately sized league. After all, he wasn't awful in seven starts for Boston last year (3.92 ERA, 1.38 WHIP). The problem is owners just can't feel good about his ability to pitch anything close to a full season at anything close to full strength.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Clayton Richard got hit around in his eight major league starts (6.04 ERA), but he posted a combined 2.47 ERA and .212 batting average against in the minors. He's a groundball pitcher, which makes him a good fit for the Cell. He could surprise if he wins the final rotation spot.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Jeff Marquez. The fifth starter spot is another area where the Sox will see a fight between a number of players. Prospect Aaron Poreda has the best stuff, but he's probably not ready yet. Richard seems to have a slight edge over the others because of his experience from last year, but Marquez and Lance Broadway, both former first-round draft picks, also have the potential to be guys AL-only owners turn to. Marquez, a groundball pitcher, came to Chicago in the Nick Swisher trade.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> Owners can feel more comfortable taking Gavin Floyd ($4.80 M) and John Danks ($4.90 M) in SN's Salary Cap games. If they match or even improve on their '08 work, their salaries will rise quickly. And if they fall short, you can jettison them and move on to this year's hot pitchers with relative ease.

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> Mark Buehrle is the perfect example of a Major League "ace" who hardly qualifies for that designation in fantasy. He doesn't have dominant stuff (career average of 5.3 K/9), but he gets the job done (career 3.80 ERA). He throws a lot of innings -- he has topped 200 in eight straight seasons -- so give him a rankings boost if your point system rewards that sort of thing.
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> For me, when it comes to deciding between Danks and Floyd, it's a coin flip. That's why when it comes time to pay coin for these guys, I'll take the one I can get cheaper: Floyd. This choice is another illustration of why you shouldn't overpay for pitching. 
<p><i>For the White Sox's projected dollar values, <a href= http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/whitesox/dollarvalues/>click here.</a></i>
<p><b>Position Battle:</b> Dayan Viciedo is an intriguing player for keeper leaguers, but the fight for third this spring likely is limited to Josh Fields and Wilson Betemit. Fields showed in '07 that he can launch balls into the seats, but he'll need to show he's not an all-or-nothing proposition at the plate. Betemit is nothing spectacular, however, so expect him to begin on the bench with Fields getting first shot at the hot corner.
<p><b>Prospect Watch:</B> Aaron Poreda is among the most intimidating pitchers in the minors. This 22-year-old is a strong 6-6 lefty who can hit 100 mph with his fastball. He doesn't have much of an offspeed offering, so he'll work on that area in the minors. Once he has something to complement his high-end heat, you can be sure he'll be racking up K's in the majors.
