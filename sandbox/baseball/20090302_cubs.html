<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Cubs.</i>
<p><b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/cubs/index.html>Cubs team page</a></b><br/>

<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>Relax, Cubs fans. I'm not going to make any jokes about goats or 100-year curses. Instead, let's put the past behind us and look forward to the 2009 season. 
<p>The two-time defending NL Central champs made a few moves this offseason, the biggest of which was signing free agent Milton Bradley to a three-year deal. He'll take over right field, likely pushing Kosuke Fukudome to center. Chicago also brought in Aaron Miles to give Mike Fontenot competition at second base now that Mark DeRosa is gone.
<p>Speaking of competition, fantasy owners will be particularly interested in who wins the closer job between setup man Carlos Marmol and newcomer Kevin Gregg. One of these two will replace former closer Kerry Wood, who left for Cleveland in free agency, and will be a lock for 30-plus saves. 
<p>Joey Gathright and Aaron Heilman will also join the Cubs this season, but they're unlikely to bring much to the fantasy table without an injury or two helping clear their respective paths. You should be able to find plenty of other fantasy options on the Cubs' roster who can help you win a championship. Sorry, but I can't help pointing out the irony in that.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>Can Ryan Dempster repeat his '08 performance?</b> 
<p>Everyone -- probably even Dempster himself -- was surprised by the righthander's outstanding '08 season (17-6, 2.96 ERA, 1.21 WHIP). After a performance like that, Dempster won't come cheaply again this year. But will he be worth his Round 6-7 draft projection?
<p>Before '08, Dempster had posted an ERA under 4.00 as a starter just once. That was with Florida when he went 14-10 with a 3.66 ERA (pervious career low as a starter), but he still had a disappointing 1.36 WHIP (also a previous career low as a starter). In fact, Dempster's '08 numbers were better than his career marks across the board. 
<p>Plus, hitters' BABIP against Dempster last season was .288, down from his career mark of .309, and his FIP was 3.41, significantly lower than his usual 4.41 mark. Expect these stats to return closer to his career averages this year, along with several other numbers. In other words, don't overpay for Dempster's career year. 
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Geovany Soto. After hitting .285-23-86 and winning the NL Rookie of the Year award last season, the only thing left for Soto to do is prove he can repeat that success. As an elite option at a notoriously thin position, Soto will be worth gambling on again this season. It'll take roughly a fourth-round pick to land the Cubs' backstop, but his production is worth it.
<br /><b>Others:</b> Derrek Lee, Aramis Ramirez, Alfonso Soriano, Ryan Theriot. 
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Milton Bradley. The Cubs took a risk by signing the oft-injured Bradley, but should fantasy owners show the same faith after an impressive '08 season? Bradley has averaged less than 100 games played per season, and that's excluding his rookie season in which he appeared in just 42. Now the former part-time DH has to stay healthy while playing the field every day? Not likely. Also, it's important to note that Bradley's career numbers last season came in a contract year. Now that he has a three-year deal in place, beware of reaching for Bradley until he's playing for his next contract. 
<br /><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Joey Gathright. Gathright's sleeper value depends on a few factors, so he's a bit of a long-shot to contribute in fantasy leagues this season. But that's what makes a good sleeper, right? Gathright has excellent speed, swiping 30 bases in limited action the past two seasons (179 games), and he proved in the minors he can hit for a high average (.315 for his career). But he'll need a spot to open in the Cubs outfield before he has a chance to help fantasy owners.  
<br /><b>Others:</b> Micah Hoffpauir.
<p><b>Going Deeper:</b> Kosuke Fukudome. The "rookie" fizzled down the stretch last season, hitting .217-3-22 in the second half after batting .279-7-36 before the break. It was likely a combination of fatigue and the competition getting a book on the Japanese import. While he could bounce back, Fukudome's home/road splits (.292/.397/.428 at home; .225/.322/.333 on road) are concerning, and his inconsistency limits him to NL-only leagues.

</table>
<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B> 
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Carlos Zambrano. Big Z could easily fit in the Buyer Beware category, but you can bet he'll be owned across the board in all formats. Zambrano has started at least 30 games the past six seasons, while averaging 15 wins. The problem is, Zambrano's nagging injuries have been increasing and he threw fewer than 200 innings in '08 for the first time since '02. Plus, his K/9 rate has dropped the past two years while his BAA has risen. That has led to a WHIP hovering around 1.30 and an ERA pushing 4.00. Don't count on Zambrano as more than a No. 3 or 4 SP. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Ted Lilly, Carlos Marmol.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Rich Harden. We all know why Harden is a risky pick, but we also know why he's so tempting. Harden has only topped 150 innings once in his career, and his 25 starts last season were the most since '04 (31) while with Oakland. When he's healthy, Harden is one of the best pitchers in baseball (10-2, 2.06 ERA, 1.06 WHIP, 11.0 K/9 in '08). But you can't bank on Harden making 30-plus starts, so make sure you don't reach for him. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Ryan Dempster. 
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Kevin Gregg. Gregg comes to Chicago to help fill the void left by the departure of closer Kerry Wood. Gregg, who had been Florida's closer the past two seasons, is expected to serve in a setup role, but he could get a shot at closing if Carlos Marmol struggles. Gregg is worth drafting late if Lou Piniella hasn't definitively named his closer yet. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Jeff Samardzija.  
<p><b>Going Deeper:</b> Sean Marshall. The tall lefty is penciled in as Chicago's No. 5 starter barring any significant struggles in spring training. This automatically makes him a target in NL-only leagues, as he'll have a solid offense behind him. He also showed some fantasy potential last season between roles as a starter and reliever, posting 3.86/1.27 line with an 8.0 K/9 rate. But beware that Marshall has struggled in the past as a starter, going 14-21 with a 4.79 ERA.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> Alfonso Soriano ($8M) and Milton Bradley ($6.3M) are great fantasy options when they're healthy, but their lengthy injury histories and lofty price tags make them bad value picks in Ultimate Fantasy Baseball. Why spend so much on the oft-injured Soriano when you could have Josh Hamilton ($7.75M) or Carlos Quentin ($7.2M) for less? And instead of dealing with Bradley's DNPs, why not invest in an up-and-coming option like Matt Kemp ($6.3M)? Even Kosuke Fukudome isn't worth his $4.5M price, so avoid overpriced Cubs outfielders in our salary cap game. The same goes for Carlos Zambrano ($7.25M), Ryan Dempster ($6.7M) and Rich Harden ($6M).

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> Carlos Marmol is a great reliever to have in points leagues. Not only will he have a great shot at 30-40 saves plus a few wins as Chicago's closer, but he also will have sparkling ERA, WHIP and K numbers. He's the total package as an RP option -- as long as he wins the job. 
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> There are several Cubs whom you'll want to avoid overpaying for in auctions because the rewards simply won't be worth the risks. By overpaying, I mean anything above our projected market value (see link below), or a dollar limit you impose. Those Cubs are: Alfonso Soriano, Milton Bradley, Ryan Dempster and Rich Harden. Soriano, Bradley and Harden are unlikely to stay healthy all season, and Bradley and Dempster are unlikely to reproduce their '08 successes. If you overpay this spring, you could really be paying for it later this summer. 
<p><i>For the Cubs' projected dollar values, <a href= http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/cubs/dollarvalues/>click here.</a></i>
<p><b>Position Battle:</b> All eyes will be on the competition between super setup man Carlos Marmol and newcomer Kevin Gregg for the closer role this spring. Lou Piniella has hinted that Marmol is the front-runner for the job, but he's said that there will be a competition in spring training. Gregg has logged 61 saves in the past two seasons while with Florida; Marmol was dominant in the setup role and notched seven saves last season while Kerry Wood was sidelined. While Marmol is the favorite to close, it's possible Piniella will keep both pitchers in their familiar roles.
<p><b>Prospect Watch:</B> Jeff Samardzija generated headlines, if nothing else, during his second-half call-up in '08. It was thought Samardzija could get a chance to close as early as this season, but that's unlikely with both Marmol and Gregg in tow. The former Notre Dame receiver will either start the season in the Cubs' bullpen or in Triple-A to be groomed as a starter. He has an electric fastball, but he needs to work on his command, so some more time in the minors could be for the best. Samardzija shouldn't be counted on to contribute in fantasy leagues this season unless a spot in the rotation opens.
