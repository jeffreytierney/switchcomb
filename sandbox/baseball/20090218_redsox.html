<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Red Sox.</i>
<p><b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/redsox/index.html>Red Sox team page</a></b><br/>
<b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/redsox/statistics/projections/>Red Sox stat projections</a></b>
<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<P>It's amazing what two World Series titles since 2004 does for a team. 
<P>Boston fans couldn't have been nearly as upset about last season's ALCS loss to Tampa Bay as they would have been back in, say, 1986. Why? 
<P>The Red Sox will be right back in the playoff race in '09. 
<p>Sure, Boston signed Rocco Baldelli, but the Red Sox didn't make the same free-agency splash as their rivals in New York. They also quietly added pitching depth and experience with veterans John Smoltz, Brad Penny and Takashi Saito. Boston also locked up Dustin Pedroia and Kevin Youkilis to long-term deals and avoided arbitration with Jonathan Papelbon. Smart moves all around. 
<P>In our most recent <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/mock_draft/1_12.html>experts mock draft</a>, nine Red Sox were taken in the first eight rounds. That included one pick in the third round (Pedroia), four more in the fourth (Daisuke Matsuzaka, Jason Bay, Papelbon, Youkilis) and one in each the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth rounds (Jacoby Ellsbury, David Ortiz, Josh Beckett, Jon Lester, respectively).
<P>There are a few sleepers out there, too. Jacoby Ellsbury will see an increase in value in his second full season, and Jed Lowrie has a chance to start at shortstop. Pitcher Jon Lester could surpass both Beckett and Matsuzaka. And what if Smoltz and Penny reemerge? 
<P>Endless possibilities, and all good ones. That's what being a championship team is all about.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>Which Josh Beckett will show up this season?</b> 
<p>In three seasons with Boston, Beckett has produced mixed results. He went from average in '06 (16-11, 5.01 ERA, 158 Ks) to excellent in '07 (20-7, 3.27, 194) back to average in '08 (12-10, 4.03, 172).  Beckett was particularly off his game last season during an injury-riddled second half (3-5, 4.19, 65 Ks in 62.1 innings). 
<P>Beckett went in the third round of our first experts mock draft, which many owners felt was way too high. If Beckett can't pitch better at Fenway Park (5-5, 5.65, 67) he won't be trustworthy as a fantasy ace. It's also worth noting that Beckett's postseason mystique took a hit last season in a loss to the Rays. Will that affect his confidence in '08? 
<P>Draft Beckett as a No. 2 or No. 3 to be on the safe side.
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Jason Bay. The former Pirate (player, not plunderer) passed all diagnostic tests after taking Manny Ramirez's place in Boston. He hit .282 with nine homers and 37 RBIs in 49 games after the trade. Project that over a full season, and the final answer is 30 homers and 122 RBIs. Bay also hit .341 with three homers and nine RBIs in the postseason. Finally, Bay doesn't draw signs in the dugout asking the team to trade him for "Brett Favre straight up." Expect nothing but good days from Bay in Fenway.  
<br/><b>Others:</b> Kevin Youkilis, Dustin Pedroia, David Ortiz.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Jason Varitek. The Red Sox looked like a desperate teenager groveling for a prom date in their offseason courtship of Varitek. Much like a limo and a $35 steak dinner, it's not always worth it. Varitek hit just .220 last season, thanks to a horrible line before the break (.218-7-28). Plus, he turns 37 in April. We get that he provides leadership-by-example in the clubhouse, but LBE is not a fantasy category. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Mike Lowell.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Jed Lowrie. Lowrie is lovable for at least one reason -- his name isn't Alex Cora or Julio Lugo. Lowrie brings something different to the lineup (a little pop), but he'll have to be more consistent. Lowrie enjoyed a monster August (.284-1-24) before coming down in September (.213-0-11). Still, Lowrie played well in the postseason, and he's the favorite to start over Lugo at short. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> J.D. Drew.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Jacoby Ellsbury. Ellsbury received mixed reviews after a topsy-turvy rookie season, but he's a perfect fit in head-to-head and points leagues. He's one of just three players who stole 50 or more bases, and he was two runs shy of 100. Considering Ellsbury hit .314 with 35 runs in the final two months and Coco Crisp is now in Kansas City, Ellsbury should be better this season.

</table>
<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B> 
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Daisuke Matsuzaka. Dice-K's second season with the Red Sox went according to plan. By now you know his nice line (18-3, 2.90 ERA, 154 Ks) comes with a high WHIP (1.32). He has "free-pass disease"; Matsuzaka was fourth in the league with 94 walks allowed. That's the only thing holding owners back. Expect more improvement in '09. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Josh Beckett, Jon Lester, Jonathan Papelbon. 
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Brad Penny. Shoulder injuries derailed Penny in '08, and he was generally ineffective for the Dodgers after starting the season as the team's ace. Penny will compete to be Boston's fourth or fifth starter, and there's reason for optimism. Penny had a 32-13 record from '06-07, and he's a lock for run support in Boston. Still, this is his first go-round in the AL, and we cannot completely trust the shoulder. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Clay Buchholz.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> John Smoltz. Smoltz turns 42 in May, is coming off major shoulder surgery and likely won't be ready until June. But he's John Smoltz. After spending all that time in Atlanta, Smoltz deserves a change of scenery. Smoltz's role when he is healthy is unclear; he could either start or set up for Papelbon. He also could fade into retirement. Still, the Red Sox have a proven track record on low-risk investments. Once again, he's John Smoltz. For what it's worth, Smoltz had a 19-6 career record in interleague play. Monitor his rehab and Boston's plans for him, with great interest. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Tim Wakefield, 42, has spent 14 seasons with the Red Sox.  Against all odds, he always wins a spot in the rotation. Back problems hampered Wakefield after the break in '08, but he still reached double-digit victories for the sixth time in the last seven seasons. Wakefield is erratic -- most knuckleballers are -- but he's still worth using in points leagues and for spot-start duty in head-to-head leagues.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> Boston has three hitters that cost at least $7M in Ultimate Fantasy Baseball in Kevin Youkilis ($7.25M), David Ortiz ($7.25M) and Jason Bay ($7M). Youkilis is the best buy out of the bunch, and not just because of his multi-position eligibility. Youkilis' totals in average, homers and RBIs have increased with each season, and it's fair to say he hasn't peaked yet. You might not like him (or his face), but he's a top-shelf buy in this format.

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> If you're going to target one stud in Boston, make it Dustin Pedroia. Youkilis and Jason Bay can fill up a stat sheet, too, but Pedroia is a more complete play. He steals more bases (20), hits more doubles (54) and strikes out less (52) than Youkilis and Bay. Last year's AL MVP still hasn't reached his 20-20 potential. That easily could happen this season.
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> David Ortiz remains the top-dollar DH at $20, but that's down $10 from last season. Injuries crippled Ortiz in '08; he failed to hit 30 homers for the first time in six seasons with Boston. Ortiz, however, managed to scrape together 89 RBIs in 109 games. He also walked almost as much as he struck out (70 BBs, 74 Ks). Considering the lack of talent at DH, Ortiz remains a sound buy.

<p><b>Position Battle:</b> As previously mentioned, Jed Lowrie will not be mistaken for Julio Lugo. Still, the two will wage a tight battle for shortstop in spring training. Lugo missed 80 games last season with various injuries, but he's still much more experienced than Lowrie. Lugo also offers more on the base paths; he had 33 stolen bases in '07. Lowrie has more fantasy upside, but it would be naive to think that Lugo will just give up shortstop. Watch this competition closely.
<p><b>Ballpark factor:</b> The homer totals are down at Fenway "Pahk." Boston hit 79 bombs at home last season, which tied with '07 for the lowest total there since '02. That hasn't affected the scoring much. The Red Sox hit .292 with 461 runs at Fenway last season. The Red Sox have averaged 471 runs there over the past five seasons, and the Green Monster is there for the taking. Fenway remains a top-10 hitter's park.
