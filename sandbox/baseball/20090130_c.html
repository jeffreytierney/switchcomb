<p><b><li><a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/rankings/c/>Complete C rankings</a></b>
<P>Ah, the catcher. It's a difficult position to fill in fantasy baseball. It can be a chore to sift through the duds to find one who can help your team. Their overall statistics are usually low compared to other position players, but with wise choices, you can hit the jackpot with your backstop.
<P>Last season, injuries occurred to big names in Jorge Posada and Victor Martinez, while a few guys who everyone expected a lot from (i.e. Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Kenji Johjima) didn't live up to the hype. Some might think catchers are headed for a slump, but there are young players breathing life into the position. 
<P>Geovany Soto tops that list. The 2008 NL Rookie of the Year flashed his talent during the end of the 2007 season and those who took notice were rewarded in '08. Joe Mauer proved everyone wrong by staying healthy, and his AL-leading .328 average showed that he's one of the best (when on the field). 
<p>Brian McCann and Russell Martin have both displayed consistency in their short times in the league, and fantasy owners can expect the same this year. The best part about these four players? They're all under the age of 26.
<P>With Jeff Clement (25), Chris Iannetta (25), Dioner Navarro (24) and Pablo Sandoval (22) also making names for themselves, few positions can offer such a nice mix of established young stars and potential upper-tier starters.
<P><b>3 UP</b>
<P><b>1. Chris Iannetta, Rockies.</b> Iannetta handled the increased workload well last year, hitting 18 home runs -- fifth among catchers. It would help if Yorvit Torrealba wasn't around, but Iannetta looks like he'll get plenty of at-bats in Colorado no matter what.
<P><b>2. Ryan Doumit, Pirates.</b> Fantasy owners have been waiting on Doumit for a long time, and he finally delivered with a .318-15-69 line in 116 games last year. And at 27, Doumit is just now entering his prime.
<P><b>3. Dioner Navarro, Rays.</b> After a disappointing '07 season, Navarro raised his average 68 points to .295 in 2008. He's not a big slugger (just seven homers last year), but it looks like he'll offer steady run production (97 combined runs and RBIs) hitting in the latter half of the Rays' stacked lineup.
<P><b>3 DOWN</b>
<P><b>1. Jarrod Saltalamacchia, Rangers.</b> Spotty playing time last year led to a decrease in hits and homers, and his strikeouts increased. Also, he was shut down in September with a strained forearm muscle. Saltalamacchia might still break out, but odds are it won't be this year. 
<P><b>2. Kenji Johjima, Mariners.</b> He hit just seven homers and his batting average plummeted to .227, largely because Johjima played in 27 fewer games than he had averaged in 2006 and '07. With Jeff Clement in town, Johjima could see even less playing time this year. 
<P><b>3. Josh Bard, Red Sox.</b> Injuries limited Bard to just 57 games last season, but he didn't do anything when healthy. He hit only .202, and connected for just one homer and 16 RBIs. A move to Boston isn't likely to help, either. 
<P><b>MEDICAL REPORT</b>
<P>It's common for catchers to suffer injuries throughout the season, and two old reliables were dealt big blows in 2008. Victor Martinez needed surgery to remove bone chips from his elbow in June and missed more than two months. He also had a nagging hamstring problem through much of April and May. However, Martinez rebounded and hit .288 in September, signaling he should be better this year. Still, the possibility of aggravation to that repaired elbow is concerning. 
<P>It's harder to read Jorge Posada's future. He was sidelined for all of May with shoulder issues, and then shut down in July. Posada had surgery and expects to be ready for the start of this season, but he's no spring chicken at 37. Last season was the first he didn't start at least 100 games since 1997, and there are questions about whether he'll be able to play catcher in the future.
<P><b>AVERAGE JOES</b>
<P><table cellpadding=3 cellspacing=1 border=0 width=100% bgcolor=CCCCCC class=v11>
<tr bgcolor="#000000" style="color: #FFFFFF;"><td align=left> <B> POOL </td><td align=left> <B> POSITION </td><td align=left> <B> AVG. </td><td align=left> <B> RUNS </td><td align=left> <B> HR </td><td align=left> <B> RBIs </td><td align=left> <B> SB </td> </tr>
<P><tr bgcolor="FFFFFF" valign=top><td align=left> Mixed </td><td align=left> C </td><td align=left> .272 </td><td align=left> 55 </td><td align=left> 12 </td><td align=left> 60 </td><td align=left> 3 </td></tr>
</table>
<P><font class=text>
<P><b>Chris Iannetta, Rockies.</b> These statistics represent the middle of the road for mixed-league catchers. Iannetta is the "most average" backstop (.264, 50 runs, 18 home runs, 65 RBIs and no steals). Look for a catcher who has projected stats better than these averages to maximize production from that position. 
<P><b>AUCTION STRATEGY</b>
<P>Spending a decent amount of money on a catcher is risky, but it can pay off. At least two catchers are worth the risk: Geovany Soto and Joe Mauer. Soto was great in his first full season, and Mauer won his second batting title while shedding some of his injury concerns.
<p>Brian McCann and Russell Martin are consistent producers who also are worth the money, just not as much. After that, you never know what you're getting, though Ryan Doumit looks like a good middle-tier option. If you want to wait until the $3 guys are the only ones left, that's fine. But remember, sometimes owners get what they pay for. Just ask those who drafted J.R. Towles last year. 
<P><b>JAKE TAYLOR WON'T BE NEEDED</b>
<P>Kelly Shoppach filled in admirably for Victor Martinez last year, finishing third among catchers with 21 home runs. But with Martinez back this year, how will the Indians divide playing time among their backstops? Martinez will get the bulk of the duties, but he'll also see playing time at first base and designated hitter. Shoppach should find his way into at least 250 at-bats, and produce well enough to warrant a late-round mixed-league draft pick. 
<P><b>SPEED KILLS</b>
<P>It's no secret that catchers aren't the swiftest of foot, but there is one guy who has wheels. Russell Martin is a standout backstop in every category, and packs extra punch with his stolen base total. His 18 steals last year wasn't monumental, but he led all catchers by eight. And it wasn't a one-season fluke. Martin stole 31 bases over the 2006 and '07 seasons. Those are huge numbers from a position that usually gets three steals or less. Couple that with Martin's double-digit home runs, and you have an elite catching option.
<P><b>Top 3 Other Power/Speed Catchers</b><br />
Mike Napoli (20 home runs and seven steals in 2008)<br />
Brian McCann (23, 5)<br />
Miguel Olivo (12, 7)
<P><b>PUDGE ABOUT TO BUST</b>
<P>For years, Ivan Rodriguez was tops when it came to catchers, but 2008 was rocky for Pudge. He was traded from the Tigers to the Yankees and his productivity hit the skids. In 96 at-bats with New York, he had just two home runs and three RBIs, a far cry from his usual numbers. Rodriguez's decreased production could have been a result of the move, or a sign of things to come for the 37-year-old. We're banking on the latter.
