<p>
<font class=text><p>Last year, Johan Santana, Jake Peavy and CC Sabathia headlined this position. Not much has changed, as we rank that trio second, third and fourth, respectively. But there's a new name at the top, and he's just one of the young pitchers who skyrocketed to fantasy stardom in 2008.
<p>Yes, Tim Lincecum, last year's N.L. Cy Young winner, is our No. 1 pitcher, and it's hard to argue after looking at his 2008 statistics. The 265 strikeouts in 227 innings were nice, but the number fantasy owners should be paying attention to is 24 -- as in Lincecum's age. His best years are ahead of him, which is scary for opposing hitters.
<p>Lincecum is one of 13 pitchers in our top 30 under the age of 27. Cole Hamels (25), Chad Billingsley (24) and Scott Kazmir (25) also join Lincecum in the top 15.
<p>Young pitchers weren't the only ones making waves last year. Several former fantasy favorites returned to upper-tier status, including Rich Harden, Cliff Lee and Ryan Dempster. Francisco Liriano, Ervin Santana and Ricky Nolasco managed to combine the themes of youth and resurgence into one, making them notable.
<p>Of course, there are plenty of old favorites here as well. Roy Halladay, Brandon Webb, Dan Haren and John Lackey are as good as ever, and they showed few signs of slowing down.
<p>This is a stacked position that offers considerable depth well into the late rounds. Sure, injuries are a concern, especially with the younger guys, but if you can find the right mix of young stars and dependable veterans, you'll be in good shape. There are plenty of both, so don't be afraid to take a few chances while you're drafting.
<p><b>3 UP</b>
<p><B>1. Edinson Volquez, Reds</b>. He didn't have as much hype as teammate Johnny Cueto, but Volquez finished the year with superior numbers. If the 25-year-old can curb his wildness (93 walks last season), he'll be a fantasy ace for years to come. As it is, his 17 wins, 3.21 ERA and 206 strikeouts in 196 innings last season are more than enough to make him a top-tier No. 2 fantasy pitcher.
<p><b>2. Ricky Nolasco, Marlins</b>. Nolasco proved his moderately successful 2006 season wasn't a fluke with a stellar '08. He finished fifth among all starting pitchers with a 1.10 WHIP. Throw in 15 wins, a 3.52 ERA and 186 strikeouts, and you have a borderline ace. He's an injury risk, but Nolasco looks like he'll continue to have success.
<p><b>3. Zack Greinke, Royals</b>. Greinke went from top prospect to bust in a short period of time. But he got his career back on track in 2008, finishing with a 3.47 ERA, 1.28 WHIP and 183 strikeouts in 202.1 innings. At only 25, Greinke's best years are still to come.
<p><b>3 DOWN</b>
<p><b>1. Fausto Carmona, Indians</b>. A hip injury had a lot to do with Carmona's decreased production, but he wasn't good even when healthy. His 1.62 WHIP and only 58 strikeouts in 120.2 innings are major red flags. He could return to his 2007 form, but don't draft him expecting that.
<p><b>2. Justin Verlander, Tigers</b>. Seventeen losses? A 4.84 ERA? A 1.40 WHIP? It's one thing to regress, but it's another thing to implode. Verlander, who will be 26 by opening day, has the talent to bounce back, but fantasy owners will still be wary.
<p><b>3. Aaron Harang, Reds</b>. In the three years leading up to last season's 6-17 disaster, Harang was one of the most consistent pitchers in the National League. But arm injuries limited his innings and, perhaps, effectiveness. Giving up a career-high 35 home runs didn't help either. The strikeout total was still decent, but fantasy owners need more than just that.
<p><b>MEDICAL REPORT</b>
<p>As always, a slew of starting pitchers spent time on the DL last year, but we'll focus on a couple whose seasons ended much earlier than expected
<p>Chien-Ming Wang's year was over in mid-June after he sprained and tore a tendon in his right foot. His ERA and WHIP were slightly up in 15 starts, but he still won eight games. Even more impressive, his K/9 ratio increased for the second straight year, up to 5.12. Wang is expected to be fully recovered for the start of this season. Don't forget about him on draft day.
<p>Erik Bedard battled injuries all season, and was eventually shut down on July 5 because of an injured left shoulder. He was decent when healthy, but his production was still far below what many expected after a trade to Seattle. Bedard is expected to be healthy for opening day, but his value took a serious hit.
<p>John Smoltz, 41, pitched only once after April because of an injured right shoulder. He had surgery and is hoping to pitch again in 2009, but it's unclear if he will be able to. And even if Smoltz does return, it's not certain whether he'll be a starter or reliever. Smoltz was great in the six appearances he made last year, but it's risky to count on him staying healthy.
<p>Two pitchers who didn't even make it as far as Smoltz were Kelvim Escobar and Curt Schilling. Both missed the entire season because of injured right shoulders. It's believed both will be ready at some point during the season, but fantasy owners don't need to take the risk. Of the two, Escobar is more likely to have an impact in 2009 since Schilling might retire.
<p>Finally, Tim Hudson and Shaun Marcum will likely miss all of this season because of Tommy John surgery. Stay away.
<p><B>AUCTION STRATEGY</b>
<p>The fact Cliff Lee was a $1 pitcher last year should tell you there are always plenty of bargains to be found with starting pitchers. But with that said, it never hurts to pay for aces like Johan Santana or CC Sabathia. You know what you're getting -- elite production every fifth day -- and that's always nice.
<p>The key is avoiding young pitchers whose values are related more to their upside than their actual track record. Felix Hernandez and Scott Kazmir are good examples of this. Sure, they could go high, but in an auction draft, you're better off waiting and finding some proven guys for cheaper. 
<p>Don't be afraid to spend money on mid-tier bounce-back candidates like John Maine and Brett Myers. They're just as likely to produce as similarly priced youngsters like Jair Jurrjens and Gavin Floyd. 
<p><b>MIGHTIER THAN THE 'PEN</b>
<p>Ryan Dempster, Justin Duchscherer, Joba Chamberlain, Jorge Campillo and Brett Myers (eventually) were just some of the players who made successful conversions from the bullpen to the rotation last season, and you can bet several more will make the switch this year. Owners are always leery of these pitchers, as injuries or decreased production are prevalent. With the exception of Dempster, all of the above players were either injured or struggled at one point in the season, but they still finished above expectations. Don't be afraid of picking up or trading for any converted relievers if they show signs of success early on.
<p>Some players to watch for initially are Chamberlain (again), Ryan Rowland-Smith (12 starts last year), Brandon Morrow (who started toward the end of last year) and Max Scherzer (seven starts, nine relief appearances in 2008).
<p><b>GIVE 'EM SOME (RUN) SUPPORT</b>
<p>For the second year in a row, Matt Cain (3.14) had the second-lowest run support average of pitchers with at least 162 innings. Because of this, Cain's record the past two years is an ugly 15-30. Of course, one look at his stat line (3.71 ERA, 1.31 WHIP and 349 strikeouts in 417.2 innings) tells us he's a better pitcher than that. Fantasy owners need to recognize the difference between bad luck and bad pitching.
<p>On the flip side is someone like Gavin Floyd, who had the third-highest RSA (6.54) and wound up with 17 wins. His peripherals last season (3.84 ERA, 1.26 WHIP) were similar to Cain's the past two years, which shows how a pitcher's win total can be skewed based on his RSA -- something that's out of his control.
<p>Again, don't rely on wins and losses to tell you everything about a pitcher's worth. Peripherals like ERA, WHIP and even non-5x5 categories like BAA (batting average against) explain more about a pitcher's ability.

<p><b>MID-TIER BREAKDOWN</b>
<p>Everyone knows you need more than an ace to have a good rotation, and it's the mid-tier guys who make or break your fantasy season. Of course, pitchers ranked in the 40-80 range are not created equal, so you need to know what to look for. Here's a quick breakdown. (Note: Just because a player falls in the "overrated" or "low-percentage" category doesn't mean he's worthless; it just means many owners view him as better than he is, which leads to drafting him higher than usual.)
<p><b>Underrated youngsters</b>: Josh Johnson, Joe Saunders, Kevin Slowey, Chris Volstad, Paul Maholm.
<p><b>Overrated youngsters</b>: Matt Garza, Mike Pelfrey, Gavin Floyd, Jair Jurrjens, Jered Weaver, Andy Sonnanstine.
<p><b>Future stars</b>: Armando Galarraga, Clayton Kershaw, Max Scherzer.
<p><b>Underrated veterans</b>: Ted Lilly, Gil Meche, Todd Wellemeyer, Hiroki Kuroda.
<p><B>Overrated veterans</b>: Mark Buehrle, Aaron Cook, Dave Bush, Kyle Lohse, Bronson Arroyo.
<p><B>High-percentage redemption seekers</b>: Chien-Ming Wang, Justin Verlander, Aaron Harang, John Maine.
<p><b>Low-percentage redemption seekers</b>: Dustin McGowan, Fausto Carmona, Chris Carpenter, John Smoltz, Scott Olsen, Johnny Cueto.
<p><B>Strikeout specialists</b>: Brett Myers, Javier Vazquez, Oliver Perez, Randy Johnson, Ubaldo Jimenez, Wandy Rodriguez, Jonathan Sanchez.
<p><B>SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S A CHANCE?!?</b>
<p>With so many young players breaking out last season, you can bet fantasy owners will be looking for the next big thing earlier in drafts this year. Don't reach too far, though -- for every youngster like Tim Lincecum, there are two or three like Phil Hughes. 
<p>Here are some players who showed flashes of brilliance last season and could be waiver-wire gold in 2009: Scott Lewis, Jeff Karstens, Matt Harrison, David Purcey, James Parr, Josh Geer, J.A. Happ, Alberto Arias, Alfredo Aceves and Ramon Ramirez.
<p><B>AVERAGE JOE</b>
<P> <table cellpadding=3 cellspacing=1 border=0 width=100% bgcolor=CCCCCC class=v11>
<tr bgcolor="#000000" style="color: #FFFFFF;"><td align=left> <B> POSITION </td><td align=left> <B> WINS </td><td align=left> <B> ERA </td><td align=left> <B> WHIP </td><td align=left> <B> Ks </td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="FFFFFF" valign=top><td align=left> SP </td><td align=left> 12 </td><td align=left> 3.75 </td><td align=left> 1.27 </td><td align=left> 143 </td></tr>
</table>
<font class=text>
<p><b>Todd Wellemeyer, Cardinals.</b> Wellemeyer's final numbers last year -- 13 wins, 3.71 ERA, 1.25 WHIP and 134 strikeouts -- were slightly better than the league averages for starting pitchers. Of course, since many owners view Wellemeyer as a below-average pitcher, this helps his value. Still, you'll want to focus on finding pitchers slotted above or near Wellemeyer on the rankings list, at least for your top five.
