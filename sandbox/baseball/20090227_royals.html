<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Royals.</i>
<p><b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/royals/index.html>Royals team page</a></b><br/>
<b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/royals/statistics/projections/>Royals stat projections</a></b>
<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>Royals general manager Dayton Moore began the offseason by <a href=http://www.kansascity.com/180/story/827259.html>telling the <i>Kansas City Star</i>'s Joe Posnanski</a> that the Royals' offense needed to evolve. "We have to understand the importance of on-base percentage," Moore said. By Joe Pos's count, Moore mentioned on-base percentage 29 times during the interview.
<P>I realize that OBP isn't a fantasy stat in most leagues, but that's our fault, not the stat's. Quite simply, OBP = offense. And when Moore said the Royals were going to get down with OBP, Royals fans could be excused for having some high hopes for Hot Stove wheelin' and dealin'. Maybe not Mark Teixeira or Manny Ramirez, but surely the Royals could have landed an OBP stud (and useful fantasy guy) like Adam Dunn or Bobby Abreu. And then reality set in.
<P><i>Coco Crisp -- come on down ... Mike Jacobs -- sure, K.C. already has tons of 1B/DH-types, but what's one more? ... Willie Bloomquist -- whatever it is that you do, you can do it in a Royals uniform for a couple years!</i>
<P>Of this group, only Coco Crisp (.331) has a career OBP even close to league-average. So much for evolution.
<P>On the other side of the ball, the Royals' pitching staff remains largely intact from 2008. Other than wondering whether Zack Greinke can build upon his breakout 2008 campaign, or whether Gil Meche can deliver another 200 innings of slightly above-average moundwork, there aren't a lot of questions marks -- just more of the same. 
<P>And when you're talking about the Royals, more of the same ain't all that great.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>Will Alex Gordon <I>finally</i> deliver the goods?</b> 
<p>Heading into the 2007 season, Alex Gordon was seen by many (including us) as the No. 1 prospect in baseball. Here we are heading into the 2009 season, and he is projected to hang around until the 16th round of fantasy drafts. Is it time to classify Gordon as a "Sean Burroughs All-Star"? I don't think so. In his sophomore campaign, Gordon increased his walks total, cut down on his strikeouts, improved his line-drive percentage and pumped up his slugging percentage. Although he isn't exactly young (he's 25), Gordon is entering his prime and should continue to improve. If you're looking for upside (and who isn't?), Gordon is a good bet. Expect something like a .270 batting average, 20-plus homers, and double-digit steals. 
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> You might have noticed that I always end up writing about the worst team in a given division. I'm sure this is in no way a commentary on my abilities as a writer. As a result, the teams I've written about have tended not to have a lot of must-own talent. The Royals are no exception. David DeJesus was the only Royal to <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/statistics/sortableStatsShell.html?sortCategory=5X5&duration=q&year=2008&league=undefined&position=H&page=1>rank in the top 100</a> in Roto value among hitters last season. Other than Gordon, there really aren't any Royals hitters that I'd target as anything more than a flier. They all come with question marks, warning signs, or a track record of mediocrity (or worse). 
<br/><B>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Hey, speaking of David DeJesus ... It took a career season for DeJesus to rank as a No. 4 mixed-league outfielder. A career-high BABIP (.338 vs. a career mark of .322) helped him to a .307 batting average, and a power surge (relatively speaking -- his .145 isolated power mark is below league-average) allowed him to hit a dozen homers. So, in the best-case scenario, you get production roughly equivalent to Russell Martin. I love Martin, but you always qualify his numbers with "great production <i>for a catcher</i>." DeJesus, sadly, isn't a catcher. If he falls back to 2006 levels (.295-8-56 with six steals), he's barely a No. 5 mixed-league outfielder. And goodness help you if he reverts to his 2007 form.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Mike Jacobs, Mike Aviles.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Remember when I bagged on the Coco Crisp deal earlier? Here's where the fantasy geek in me strikes back. Crisp almost rated as a mixed-league No. 5 outfielder last season despite splitting time in the Red Sox lineup with Jacoby Ellsbury. Given a full-time starting job with the Royals, Crisp is going to steal 30-plus bases while hitting for average and scoring runs at the top of the order. He shouldn't have lasted until the 20th round in the last <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/mock_draft/13_23.html>experts mock draft</a>, but he did.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Alex Gordon.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Billy Butler was supposed to play Lennon to Gordon's McCartney (or McCartney to Gordon's Lennon, depending on your point of view), but so far he's managed only 772 at-bats of remarkably mediocre production -- his career line of .282/.334/.420 is pretty darned close to the AL average of .267/.335/.420. Keep in mind, though, that he won't turn 23 until April. He has plenty of room for improvement, and even modest gains against righties (and a full season of at-bats) could produce a .290 average and close to 20 homers. It's not hard to imagine Butler developing into an AL-only starting first baseman this season.

<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Zack Greinke's 2008 season had it all -- strikeouts, ERA, WHIP, innings, even 13 wins (good for a top-20 finish in that category). With his personal problems behind him, Greinke is past the "comeback" stage and poised for another successful season. His 2008 peripherals (.318 BABIP, 3.56 FIP, 3.27 K/BB) don't warn of any imminent collapse, so don't talk yourself out of drafting a solid mixed-league No. 2 starter. Wins will always be a concern, but I draft pitchers on what they can control, not their run support.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Joakim Soria.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> The Royals don't really have any wolves in sheep's clothing. Greinke, Soria, and Meche are worthwhile fantasy commodities, and fantasy owners are well aware that the Royals' other pitchers just aren't. If you're thinking about taking a flier on Brian Bannister as a rebound candidate, keep in mind that his FIP ERA in 2008 was 5.03, he allowed a perfectly normal .316 BABIP, and his K/BB was actually <i>better</i> than it was in 2007. There's no real reason to take a chance on him other than blind faith or a dare.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Luke Hochevar.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> When K.C. made Gil Meche $55 million richer in 2007, I chalked it up to the Royals being the Royals. Lo and behold, he has delivered two seasons of 200-plus innings each while compiling a 3.82 ERA. Still, Meche's average draft position  is 205. That seemed awfully low for a man of Meche's abilities, so I wasted some time and found that in 2008, Meche ranked 124th among all players in Roto value. In 2007, he ranked 181st. While not quite a sleeper, it seems to me that Meche is at least underrated, which is almost certainly the byproduct of pitching in Kansas City. A proven innings-eater, Meche can provide a sub-4.00 ERA and a healthy dose of strikeouts at a very reasonable price.
<br/><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Carlos Rosa had a cup of coffee with Kansas City last season before his name came up during the Mike Jacobs trade negotiations, but the Royals chose to hang on to his mid-90s fastball and solid slider. Rosa logged a 2.73 ERA between Double-A and Triple-A last season while striking out 86 batters in 95.2 innings. The Royals have yet to decide whether he'll start or relieve in the majors, but AL-only owners looking for strikeouts and possible dual SP/RP eligibility should keep an eye on Rosa during spring training.

<font class=text>	
<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> Zack Greinke costs $5.2M in our Ultimate Salary Cap game,  which is amazing when you consider that shakier options such as Chien-Ming Wang, Aaron Harang, and a bunch of closers cost more. Get in while the cost is low. Greinke started last season with a 3-0 record in April with a 1.25 ERA. A deal this good won't last long.
<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> As mentioned before, the Royals are a little lacking in OBP. In fact, they ranked 26th in the majors last year in OBP, while coming in at No. 25 in slugging percentage. So, it's not surprising that their top two points leaguers from last year (Jose Guillen and David DeJesus) <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/statistics/sortableStatsShell.html?sortCategory=PTS&duration=q&year=2008&league=undefined&position=H&page=1>barely snuck into the top 100</a> among points-league hitters last season. The Royals' most valuable options in this format are co-aces Zack Greinke and Gil Meche, who log the innings (and rack up the Ks) you need to win. Draft one of them as your No. 3 and you'll be sitting pretty.
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> When you're at your AL-only auction and your fellow owners are throwing out double-digit bids for Lyle Overbay, Nick Swisher, Hank Blalock or Paul Konerko, just sit back and smile. I'd wager $7 (the going rate) that Billy Butler will produce similar (if not better) value than those "proven veterans" will manage. 
<p><b>Position Watch:</b> What is it with Missouri teams trying to convert outfielders into second basemen? While the Cardinals try to repurpose Skip Schumaker as a second baseman, the Royals are conducting a similar experiment with Mark Teahen. Early results have not been great (he committed two errors in his keystone debut), but eligibility at second would make Teahen an AL-only starter and the ultimate Swiss Army knife player. He already qualifies at first base, third base and the outfield, although he isn't a particularly attractive option at any of them.
<p><b>Prospect Watch:</b> The Royals don't have any true studs on the horizon for '09, but they do have a couple of nice options for fantasy owners whose leagues feature minor-league keeper rosters (By the way, I'll just throw in that minor-league keeper rosters make playing fantasy baseball 10 times more nerdy and awesome). Although sometimes referred to as a shortstop, Mike Moustakas is almost certainly destined to play third base. That's OK, because he has plenty of bat for the position. In his full-season debut, Moustakas batted .272 while leading the Low Class-A Midwest League in homers (22) despite being just 19.  
<P>Depending on whom you ask, some think that 2008 first-round pick Eric Hosmer is an even better prospect than Moose Tacos. A first baseman out of Florida, Hosmer was viewed by many as the best high school hitter in the draft. He projects to give the Royals raw power and a good average from first base, assuming the Royals haven't signed Mike Jacobs to a 10-year extension by the time Hosmer's ready.
