<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Orioles.</i>
<p><b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/orioles/index.html>Orioles team page</a></b><br/>
<b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/orioles/statistics/projections/>Orioles stat projections</a></b>
<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>One of the Orioles' first moves this offseason was to unveil re-designed jerseys -- nothing earth-shattering, but the new road jerseys now say "Baltimore" rather than "Orioles." The residents of Charm City might not be eager to claim a team that hasn't finished above .500 since 1997, but there's reason to believe that the team's fortunes are looking up. 
<P>While lacking a true blockbuster name, the O's figure to have an above-average offense this season with continued improvement from Nick Markakis and Adam Jones. This year's round of Brian Roberts trade rumors never panned out, but the trade of Ramon Hernandez to the Reds opened the door for the Matt Wieters Era. 
<P>The Orioles also brought in some arms (Mark Hendrickson, Rich Hill and Japanese import Koji Uehara) to follow nominal ace Jeremy Guthrie, but pitching figures to remain a problem for a team that ranks 26th in ERA (4.91) this decade. Baltimore's minor-league system has some promising options, but help likely won't arrive until after the All-Star break at the earliest.
<P>Like their Beltway buddies in D.C., the Orioles don't figure to play ball in October, but they've got some up-and-coming stars who can help fantasy owners.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>Can Matt Wieters live up to the hype?</b> 
<p>Imagine if Chuck Norris were a baseball player. Now imagine if Chuck Norris weren't just a baseball player, but a switch-hitting catcher who could hit for power and average. You're starting to get an idea of Matt Wieters' potential. The Orioles' 2007 first-round pick (drafted as a junior out of Georgia Tech, where he also closed) compiled a .355/.454/.600 line in his first pro season, finishing with 12 homers in 208 at-bats at Double-A Bowie. With Gregg Zaun on board, the O's now say that Wieters will begin the season at Triple-A, but remember that Evan Longoria started 2008 in the minors (as did Ryan Braun in 2007). If you make just one prospect pick this draft season, make it Wieters.
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Brian Roberts isn't getting any younger, but he also doesn't seem to be slowing down. While signing him to a four-year deal to appease the fan base isn't the wisest move the O's could make, fantasy owners could do much worse than sign up for another season of steals, batting average and runs from this upper-tier second baseman. His high on-base percentage not only gives him more chances to steal, but it also makes him an especially good pick in points leagues.
<br/><B>Others:</b> Nick Markakis.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Aubrey Huff ranked 18th in Roto value among hitters last season. Wrap your head around that one. I don't think he's due for a Gary Matthews Jr.-like fall, but I also don't expect him to bat .300 with 30-plus homers again. It's just too late in the game for Huff (32) to consider last season anything other than a moderate fluke. Expect him to hit .280 with around 20 homers -- good enough stats for a CI, but not worthy of starting at first base for you. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Melvin Mora, Cesar Izturis.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Adam Jones is <a href=http://misterirrelevant.com/index.php/2008/04/07/shhh-narcoleptic-adam-jones-is-dreaming-of-winning-the-al-east/>a natural</a> for this category, don't you think? The former Mariners prospect was putting together a nice little rookie season before a foot injury derailed his second half. Another year older and allegedly 25 pounds heavier (all muscle, just like me), Jones' career arc is on the upswing. Expect marked improvement in his second go-round, with a .275 average, 20 homers, and 15 steals serving as attainable goals. Draft him to fill out your mixed-league outfield. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Matt Wieters (if a guy I just compared to Chuck Norris can count as a sleeper).
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Felix Pie has yet to produce on his former prospectdom, but he'll be given another chance in Baltimore as the better half of a LF platoon. Still just 24, Pie compiled a .299 batting average over 2,500 minor league at-bats and should get a look from AL-only owners, who won't have to risk much on a guy with upside to spare. He's a safe bet to reach the teens in both homers and steals.

<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B> (300 words)
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Jeremy Guthrie comes closest to fitting this description, but a mediocre K/9 mark combined with an exceedingly lucky BABIP lead me to think his days of sub-4.00 ERAs are over. Of course, I'd have said the same thing last year, and I'd have been wrong. Some guys defy logic. With that said, Guthrie's best-case scenario grades out as a back-end mixed league starter -- he ranked 51st among starters in Roto value last season despite posting a career-best 3.63 ERA. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> George Sherrill logged 31 saves last season, but they came attached to a 4.73 ERA and a 1.50 WHIP (granted, his 9.8 K/9 mark isn't anything to sneeze at). All told, Sherrill produced just 4.97 Roto points in 2008, ranking below such setup men as Matt Thornton and Joey Devine. He enters spring training as the Orioles' de facto closer, but he'll have to fight to keep the job.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Koji Uehara.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Chris Ray missed all of the 2008 season following Tommy John surgery, but he racked up 49 saves with solid indicators (7.9 K/9, 1.24 WHIP, 2.11 K/BB) during the 2006 and 2007 seasons. We'll have to wait and see how much of the old Chris Ray is left, but his name is already being mentioned as a closer candidate. George Sherrill's loss could be Ray's gain. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Chris Tillman (see "Prospect Watch" below).
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Like fellow Cubbie ex-pat Felix Pie, Rich Hill came to Baltimore after running out of options in the Windy City. Hill threw just 19.2 big-league innings last season, walking 18 batters in the process. Still, it's important to note that the Cubs chose to pay more attention to his last 19.2 innings than the previous 294.1, which saw Hill log a 4.00 ERA and strike out 8.3 batters per nine innings. He's not young by any means, but Hill is a bounce-back gamble for AL-only owners looking to fill out their rotation.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> The key to playing Ultimate Fantasy Baseball is knowing when to get in on a given player -- and when to get out. Study up on first-half/second-half and monthly splits. Aubrey Huff, for example, has a career second-half OPS (.876) that's nearly 100 points higher than his first-half mark (.780). Brian Roberts, meanwhile, has compiled a paltry .253/.319/.358 line over the last three Septembers.
<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> Baseball fans know that .406 is a magical number. Nick Markakis put up a .406 mark last season, albeit in OBP rather than batting average. Still, breaking the .400 mark in OBP is a nifty accomplishment -- only 10 batters did so last season. Markakis might not hit an eye-popping number of homers, but his ability to draw walks helps make him a top-20 points league hitter (his 40-plus doubles don't hurt, either).
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> Not to keep picking on Jeremy Guthrie, but $16 is a lot of money for a guy who was out-earned by Kyle Lohse last year. Five guys who (a) cost less than Guthrie and (b) will give you more bang for your buck: Zack Greinke ($15), Matt Cain ($14), Derek Lowe ($14), Matt Garza ($13), and Aaron Harang ($12) ... and the Big Unit ($8) for good measure. 
<p><b>Position Watch:</b> Newly acquired Ty Wigginton put up a .285-23-58 line with the Astros last season, producing great value for owners who plugged him in at second base or middle infielder. Unfortunately, not only is Wigginton no longer eligible at second base, he'll also struggle to find playing time barring injuries to Melvin Mora, Ryan Freel and/or Felix Pie. 
<p><b>Prospect Watch:</b> Other than Matt Wieters, the Orioles' prospect most likely to make an impact this season is righty Chris Tillman, who struck out 154 batters in 135.2 innings last season at Double-A Bowie. Acquired in the Erik Bedard deal (which also netted George Sherrill and Adam Jones), Tillman figures to start the season in Triple-A, but he could bring his low-90s fastball and plus curve to a MLB boxscore near you in the second half. Other names to track: SP Brian Matusz, SP Jake Arrieta, and OF/DH Nolan Reimold.
