<p><b><li><a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/rankings/rp/>Complete RP rankings</a></b>
<p>Here's something you probably know: Major League Baseball has 30 teams. Here's something you might not know: Only one-third of those teams had the same closer all season in 2008. 
<p>And, to be honest, we even had to cheat to get it to one-third because Brad Lidge technically spent the first week of the season on the D.L.
<p>Yes, only 10 teams -- the Angels, Astros, Giants, Padres, Phillies, Red Sox, Reds, Royals, Twins and Yankees -- were able to count on the same guy in the ninth inning all season, which means fantasy owners were scrambling to the waiver wire in search of fill-in closers. And it's a trend that's likely to continue.
<p>Many owners might view this as a reason to use a high draft pick on the few consistent options -- Jonathan Papelbon, Mariano Rivera, Joe Nathan and Francisco Rodriguez -- that do exist. But no matter the name or track record, there's still a great deal of risk with any reliever. Just ask owners who spent a fourth-round pick on J.J. Putz last year (or B.J. Ryan the year before that).
<p>Relievers have a high injury rate and a high turnover rate. It's amazing how quickly a closer can blow out an arm or go from "dominating" to "worthless." Yes, Billy Wagner and Manuel Corpas, we're looking at you.
<p>If you're patient in the draft and work the waiver wire effectively during the season, you shouldn't have a problem fielding a team with decent closers who can keep you competitive in saves all year long. And if you're really trying to maximize production from your relief pitcher spots, you can grab one or two elite setup men in the final rounds of your draft. They'll help your ERA, WHIP and Ks more than an average closer, and you'll be getting them for a fraction of the cost. And if you find the right ones, you might have yourself a quality closer before the year is up (see Broxton, Jonathan). It seems to be the way things are going for this notoriously fickle group.
<p><b>3 UP</b>
<p><b>1. Joakim Soria, Royals</b>. He has one of the coolest nicknames in baseball (the Mexecutioner) and some of the nastiest stuff of any reliever. Soria proved '07 was no fluke, saving 42 of 45 games and finishing with the second-lowest WHIP (0.86) among closers in '08. He's the real deal.
<p><b>2. Kerry Wood, Indians</b>. Wood spent some time on the D.L., but he still made 65 appearances last year -- nearly triple the amount he made in '07. He saved 34 of 40 games and had the 10th-highest K/9 ratio (11.4) of any reliever with at least 40 innings. He's still an injury risk, but at least he showed he can be an effective closer.
<p><b>3. Jose Arredondo, Angels</b>. Arredondo came out of nowhere for the Angels and used a good fastball and hard breaking stuff to overpower hitters (1.62 ERA, 1.05 WHIP, .190 batting average against) while being used as a middle reliever last year. Sound familiar? Yes, Arredondo's rise through the Angels' organization is similar to Francisco Rodriguez's. He won't strike out quite as many as K-Rod, but all the pieces are in place for Arredondo to be a solid ninth-inning guy should the Angels need him to close in the future.
<p><b>3 DOWN</b>
<p><b>1. J.J. Putz, Mets</b>. Arm troubles limited Putz to 47 appearances last year, and he managed just 15 saves while compiling a 1.60 WHIP. So much for being a top-ranked relief pitcher, huh? Putz is expected to be healthy when spring training starts, but he has little value outside of NL-only leagues now that he's a setup man for the Mets.
<p><b>2. Huston Street, Rockies</b>. Street's final numbers with the A's look decent (3.73 ERA, 1.21 WHIP, 69 Ks in 70 innings), but he lost his closer's job in early August after blowing six saves. Now in Colorado, it's unlikely his declining stats will get much better, and he'll have to battle for save opportunities with Taylor Buchholz and Manuel Corpas.
<p><b>3. Chad Cordero, FA</b>. Cordero made only six appearances last year because of a troublesome right shoulder, and he'll likely have to prove himself as a middle reliever before being allowed to close again. It wouldn't be a shock to see him get save chances before the year is through, but don't count on that on draft day.
<p><b>AUCTION STRATEGY</b>
<p>Two-for-one specials aren't only great at your local bar, they're also a good way to approach bidding on relievers in an auction draft. Confused? We'll explain.
<p>If you target two decent, mid-tier options, you can get solid production while avoiding the risk of investing a ton of money on an elite closer. For instance, you can probably get Mike Gonzalez (11.76 K/9 ratio, 1.19 WHIP) and Trevor Hoffman (9.13 K/9, 1.04 WHIP) for less than Jonathan Papelbon (10.00 K/9, 0.95 WHIP). Or you could grab two up-and-comers like Frank Francisco (11.79 K/9, 1.15 WHIP) and Matt Lindstrom (6.75 K/9, 1.45 WHIP) for about the same price as Jose Valverde (10.38 K/9, 1.18 WHIP).
<p>Sure, it's nice to have one of the high-priced guys, but going the two-for-one route could help you avoid paying big bucks for a big bust.
<p><b>MEDICAL REPORT</b>
<p>The injury bug bit several relievers last year, but Billy Wagner was its most significant victim.
<p>The Mets' closer was having another sensational season before a left elbow/forearm injury shut him down in early August. He eventually underwent Tommy John surgery and will miss the entire '09 season.
<p>Chris Ray, who saved 33 games in '06, will be looking to return after missing all of '08 while recovering from -- you guessed it -- Tommy John surgery. Ray will be hoping for similar results as B.J. Ryan and Mike Gonzalez, who both returned to closing last year after undergoing Tommy John surgery in '07.
<p>Also missing significant chunks of the '08 season were: Takashi Saito (right elbow), Matt Capps (right shoulder), George Sherrill (left shoulder), Troy Percival (various) and Chad Cordero (right shoulder). Mariano Rivera had offseason surgery on his right shoulder, but he is expected to be ready for spring training.
<p><B>K-FRAUD</b>
<p>You've probably heard people talk about Francisco Rodriguez's "unbelievable" '08 season. Two things about it were unbelievable -- the amount of save opportunities he received, and how overrated he was because of that.
<p>Rodriguez received 69 save opportunities last season. To put that in perspective, Jose Valverde was next on the list with 51. 
<p>So, yes, Rodriguez's record-setting 62 saves were remarkable, but several closers would have saved just as many, if not more, given that many opportunities.
<p>Now, we're not saying Rodriguez isn't a great closer -- he is. But his 1.29 WHIP last year is far from elite. And the fact that he has blown 13 saves in the past two years is worrisome, as are his declining strikeout numbers (10.14 K/9 in '08, down from 12.03 in '07). 
<p>Rodriguez's proven track record makes him one of the few reliable closers out there, but don't let those fluky 62 saves from last season trick you into overpaying for him on draft day this year.
<p><b>TWO'S A CROWD</b>
<p>Several closer situations are cloudy heading into next season, but it's because there are at least two viable candidates as opposed to a group of unproven question marks.
<p>The best example comes from the north side of Chicago, where the Cubs will have to choose between newly acquired Kevin Gregg, and super-setup man Carlos Marmol. Marmol, who saved seven games and had 114 Ks in 87.1 innings last year, is likely to be the favorite, but Gregg has saved 61 games the past two years. He has the experience and stuff to get the job done, so there could be an open competition in spring training.
<p>Arizona (Chad Qualls, Jon Rauch), Atlanta (Mike Gonzalez, Rafael Soriano), Baltimore (Chris Ray, George Sherrill), Colorado (Huston Street, Manuel Corpas) and Detroit (Brandon Lyon, Fernando Rodney, Joel Zumaya) are other teams with experienced closers competing for the ninth-inning job.
<p><b>CLOSED FOR BUSINESS</b>
<p>Long-time relievers Salomon Torres and Todd Jones retired in the offseason, and Joe Borowski has been out of baseball since early July. Jason Isringhausen, who struggled and suffered a hand injury last year, might have also closed his last game.
<P><B>SLEEPER IN ST. LOUIS</b>
<p>Chris Perez was a popular pickup when he took over the Cardinals' closer duties last year, and he's the favorite for the job at the start of '09. But he'll have some competition from Jason Motte. As a September call-up last year, Motte yielded one earned run while striking out 16 in 11 innings. Even more impressive, he whiffed 110 batters in 66.2 innings at Triple-A in '08. Even if he doesn't win the closer's job, Motte's strikeout ability can help any fantasy team. 
<p><b>HOLD THAT THOUGHT</b>
<p>Having at least one low-WHIP/high-K setup man is a good way to help your peripherals, increase your strikeouts and steal a few wins. And, as previously discussed, you never know when a setup man will turn into a closer.
<p>If you're in a league that rewards holds, you already know how valuable middle relievers can be. There's a high turnover rate among the leaders in holds every year (see chart), so it's tough to figure out a strategy for them while drafting. Ideally, you'd like a player from a good team, but anyone can get a lot of holds. Your best bet is simply taking the best available middle-reliever. Even if he doesn't get holds, your ERA and WHIP won't be hurt.

<p>Huston Street (18 saves, 3.73 ERA, 1.21 WHIP, 8.87 K/9) was the "most average" player among relievers with at least five saves last year. Try to grab at least two pitchers ranked above him during your draft.
