<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Braves.</i>

<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>These aren't your older brother's Braves. 
<P>Atlanta fell to 72-90 for a fourth-place finish in the NL East last season, its lowest win total since 1990. That was the year before Bobby Cox took over as manager. 
<P>Cox is back for his 19th season, however, and he'll have a remodeled rotation to work with. Derek Lowe, Javier Vazquez and Kenshin Kawakami signed with Atlanta this offseason. It's not exactly Smoltz-Maddux-Glavine in nature, though Tom Glavine may be back from elbow surgery to round out the bottom of the rotation. Second-year starter Jair Jurrjens is worth a look, along with closer Mike Gonzalez. 
<P>Veterans Chipper Jones and Brian McCann remain the big boppers in a lineup that hasn't made any major changes yet (a deal for Rafael Furcal fell through and the Braves are still searching for a power-hitting outfielder). McCann arguably is the top catcher in fantasy baseball. Atlanta's success, however, hinges on Jones' health. Jones missed 34 games last season and hasn't played in more than 140 games since 2003. The Braves also have two up-and-coming fantasy role players in infielders Kelly Johnson and Yunel Escobar. 
<P>Atlanta has what it takes to get back to .500, but don't hold out hope for a 15th division title under Cox.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>What can owners expect from the new SPs?</b> 
<P>Derek Lowe, Javier Vazquez and Kenshin Kawakami all bring a different skill set to the table, which will make for an improved, but not-there-yet, rotation. 
<P>Lowe increased his stock with a dominant second half in '08 (7-3, 2.38 ERA, 59 Ks), but he was just 54-48 in four seasons with the Dodgers. He's still the best bet for success. 
<p>Vazquez is a risky pick. He finished 12-16 with a 4.67 ERA last season and carried an 11-15 record with a 4.42 ERA in his last NL stint with the Diamondbacks in '05. He's good for 200-plus strikeouts, but buy at your own risk.
<P>Japanese pitchers are tough reads, but at least Kawakami has experience on his side. The 33-year-old hit the 200-inning mark only once with the Chunichi Dragons. Expect the usual growing pains and make Kawakami no more than a late-round flier. 
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Chipper Jones hit above .400 through June 18 and finished with a league-leading .364 average. Jones also battled quad, hamstring and shoulder ailments that cost him 34 games. Jones turns 37 in April, so you have to figure the injuries will continue and get worse. But so will the hitting. Jones has 20 or more homers in all of his major-league seasons. All he needs is more RBI opportunities.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Yunel Escobar, Brian McCann.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Casey Kotchman's first stint in the National League was an unnatural disaster. He hit .237 with two homers and 20 RBIs in 43 games after coming over from Los Angeles. The damage was done by the time Kotchman got his act together in September (.305-2-15). Even in a full-time role, Kotchman has a 15-homer, 75-RBI ceiling. That won't do at a loaded position.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Matt Diaz.  
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> A former Fantasy Source staff member called Jeff Francoeur the "bane of my existence" more than once in '08. Francoeur's lowlights included a .239 average and a demotion to Double-A Mississippi. Still, Francoeur did average 24 homers and 104 RBIs the previous two seasons. We're also hearing another, "he's lost 15-20 pounds and is fired up" story. Francoeur should be available in Round 20. Why not? 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Gregor Blanco, Kelly Johnson. 
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Josh Anderson hit .296 with 21 runs and seven stolen bases last September in 98 at-bats. Anderson hit .358 in 21 games with the Astros in '07. Watch him emerge as a three-category player if he lands the starting center field job. The downside with Anderson is that he struck out once every 4.12 at-bats in '08. He's still worth investigating in the later rounds of NL-only drafts.

</table>
<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B> 
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Mike Gonzalez returned from Tommy John surgery in June '08 and solidified the closer spot for the Braves. He converted 14 of 16 save opportunities, and he did so with an excellent K-to-BB ratio (44-to-14). Gonzalez has nailed down 44 of 49 save opportunities in his career, a conversion rate of almost 90 percent. The high '08 ERA (4.28) is worrisome, but a closer is a closer and Gonzalez comes cheap. Make him your No. 2 RP between Rounds 14-16.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Derek Lowe.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> As previously mentioned, it's hard to put complete trust in Javier Vazquez. He's a wonderful strikeout pitcher, notching at least 200 in each of the last two seasons. That hasn't translated into wins or a low ERA, however. Vazquez has won 15 or more games only twice in his career and his ERA has been above 4.40 in four of the last five campaigns.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Tom Glavine, Jorge Campillo. 
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Kenshin Kawakami is the de facto sleeper because we haven't seen him pitch against major-league hitters. One thing working in Kawakami's favor is his consistency. He recorded double-digit victories five of the last seven seasons while maintaining an ERA under 4.00 in Japan. Kawakami has an orthodox delivery, and all indications are he isn't a power pitcher. He's worth monitoring through spring training, but no more than a late-round selection until further notice.
<br/><b>Others:</b> None. 
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Jair Jurrjens' name might sound like an awful character from a "Star Wars" movie, but his game is anything but embarrassing. Jurrjens surged to a 9-4 record with a 3.00 ERA before the break, but regressed in the second half (4-6, 4.66). Still, he managed to produce a winning record on an awful team, and the 139 strikeouts were a nice touch. The additions of Lowe and Vazquez mean better pitching matchups this year. Jurrjens is a high-priority, NL-only pick.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> Yunel Escobar ($5M) is a thrifty buy as the 12th-most expensive SS in Ultimate Fantasy Baseball. Escobar's line (.288-10-60) should improve, and he's an underrated source of runs (71 in '08). Crossing home plate that many times for last year's offensively-starved team is quite an accomplishment. One more sign that Escobar can be special is his K-to-BB ratio (62-to-59). All the Braves need to do is teach him how to steal second base.

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> Campillo will be a valuable late-round pick if he does indeed beat out Tom Glavine for a rotation spot. Campillo finished 8-7 with a 4.34 ERA as a starter in '08. Campillo's true value lies in his K-to-BB ratio. He finished with 107 strikeouts against just 38 walks in 158.2 innings last season. 
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> Don't pay top dollar for Chipper Jones. At about $23, he's not quite as reliable as the third basemen around him (Garrett Atkins, Kevin Youkilis). But that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to get Jones on the cheap. Throw out a mid-range amount ($10-$12), but don't get into a bidding war. You might be able to land Jones at half his projected price.

<p><b>Position Battle:</b> Matt Diaz played in just 43 games last season because of a bothersome knee injury, but the Braves brought him back. He'll have every opportunity to take the left-field job away form Gregor Blanco. Diaz hit .338 in '07, so a quick takeover isn't out of the question. Diaz must prove he's healthy in spring training. If he can do that, he'll be a sneaky, late-round pick for NL-only leaguers.
<p><b>Prospect Watch:</B> The Jan. 5 edition of <i>Sporting News</i> picked pitcher Tommy Hanson as a potential breakout player for '09. The 6-6 righthander certainly has the tools that make owners drool. Hanson has 373 Ks in 322.2 minor-league innings, and opponents have hit just .199 against him. Hanson likely won't be in the opening day rotation, but the words "Hanson" and "called up" will be in the same sentence come midseason. We won't let you forget about him.
