<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>Only the Nationals had a worse record last year than Seattle (61-101), so this franchise had a lot of work to do over the offseason. It started with finding a new GM (Jack Zduriencik) and manager (Don Wakamatsu). As far as player movement, the Mariners were part of a three-team, 12-player deal that sent star closer J.J. Putz to the Mets. As part of the deal, the team upgraded its outfield defense with Franklin Gutierrez and Endy Chavez. 
<P>The Mariners made their biggest offseason splash right as spring camp opened. The team announced that it had lured Ken Griffey Jr. back to allow him to finish his brilliant career where it started 20 years ago, even if it wasn't exactly phrased that way. Consider it a move to engender good will with the fans for a season that likely will result in another losing team.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<P><B>It can't be any worse that last year, can it?</B>
<P>The M's entered last season with serious hopes of contending for the AL West and then finished 39 games back. So simply from an expectations standpoint, there's no way it can be as bad. But can it be much better? Probably not. The lineup lacks teeth, the back of the rotation looks like it's had its teeth knocked out, and the closer search is so broad it might include the Tooth Fairy. What does that mean for fantasy owners? Expect a similar offensive attack to the one that finished last year 26th in the majors in runs and homers. As for the pitching, the upgraded outfield defense could help lower the ERA a tiny bit, but wins will remain tough to come by for the starters.    
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> How good is Jose Lopez at the plate? Consider that the Mariners contemplated moving him to first base this offseason before settling on strikeout king Russell Branyan and youngster Bryan LaHair at the position. That's great news for fantasy owners, who can benefit from this middle-of-the-order hitter at a position that doesn't offer many of them. Chase Utley and Dan Uggla were the only second basemen to drive in more runs than Lopez last year (89), and at 25, he has yet to hit his prime. Although there's a noticeable rankings drop-off after the first seven 2B, there's no shame in "settling" for Lopez five or six rounds after those guys are gone.  
<br/><b>Others:</b> Ichiro Suzuki
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> If you look purely at Adrian Beltre's homer numbers over the past three years, you'll see remarkable consistency. Getting 25 homers from him seems close to guaranteed. But one alarming point about his 2008 numbers is the dramatic drop in doubles (from 41 in '07 to 29). It could be nothing, but when you add the fact his run and RBI numbers also sank (with the rest of the Seattle offense), it does create some doubts about whether you can count on him as a mixed league third baseman. Corner infielder? Sure, but not your starting third baseman.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Ken Griffey Jr.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Franklin Gutierrez. This lineup is full of snoozers, not so much sleepers. Jeff Clement or Wladimir Balentien <i>could</i> take big steps forward in their second season, but will they get the playing time now that Griffey is here? And everyone's rooting for good guy Mike Sweeney to make the team as a minor-league invite, but really, how much baseball is left in his 35-year-old body? If forced to take someone here, I'll go with Gutierrez, but I liked him much more coming out of '07 (.266-13-36 in 271 at-bats) than out of '08 (.248-8-41 in 399 at-bats).
<br/><b>Others:</b> 
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Yuniesky Betancourt doesn't flash much power or speed, and he has fewer walks in four major leagues seasons (60) than Albert Pujols had in the first half last year (61, and that was with a DL stint). Betancourt is a consistent hitter who will produce enough to merit his starting spot in AL-only leagues. Plus, he might even carry a bit of upside this season because the M's areset on making him their No. 2 hitter.  Last year, Betancourt hit .327-2-12 with 16 runs in 25 games at the No. 2 spot.

<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B> 
<p><b>Must Own:</b>Felix Hernandez. Year after year, owners draft Hernandez expecting big things, and they usually end up a tad disappointed. King Felix's win total last season (9) was downright servant-like, and there's nothing lordly about a 1.39 WHIP. So why put him here? Consider it a minor leap of faith in a pitcher who, despite starting 104 games in his major league career, is still just 22 and has a K/9 around 8. One of these years, his immense talent and his gaining knowledge will combine to make him a top-10 starter. Why not take a chance that it's this year? As No. 2 starters go, he comes with minimal downside.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Erik Bedard. Bedard can post numbers on par with Hernandez, if not better. The reason he falls here is he has started more than 28 games only once in the past five seasons, and his '08 season ended in early July because of shoulder surgery. Injuries have cropped up again as Bedard missed Wednesday's start because of right hip soreness. He's a good example of a risk/reward choice. Even though he was hurting last year, his numbers (3.67 ERA, 1.32 WHIP, 8.0 K/9) were solid.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Brandon Morrow. The fifth overall pick in the '06 draft, Morrow was considered by some scouts to have the best pure arm in that draft, which also included some kids named Tim Lincecum and Clayton Kershaw. His mid-to-upper 90s fastball gives him strikeout stuff, but he needs to continue to improve his offspeed offerings. Morrow is a converted reliever, so the soreness in his forearm this spring provides cause for concern about his ability to hold up to a starter's workload this year (and be available for the start of the season).
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Ryan Rowland-Smith. You probably know Jarrod Washburn and Carlos Silva can be serviceable major-league starters (at times), but they do nothing to make the hearts of fantasy owners (or Mariners coaches) go pitter patter. That's why Rowland-Smith will get a long look as a rotation candidate this spring after posting a 3.50 ERA in 12 starts last year. This Aussie lefty is buried in most rankings, but really, would you rather have Silva or another shaky vet over this unknown with potential? I've moved him into my top 100 at SP if that helps with your answer.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> Jose Lopez is a nice MI value at $3.85, nearly the same price as no-bat Cesar Izturis or no-starting spot Bobby Crosby. But the best bargains here could come from the bullpen. Mark Lowe and Tyler Walker both are priced at the league minimum ($.50 M), and if one of them steps forward as the closer, that person should see a decent climb. It won't be a phenomenal increase, however, because the Mariners will provide only so many save opportunities.

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> It's tough to knock a career .331 hitter who has stolen at least 30 bases and scored at least 100 runs in each of his eight seasons. But points league owners will need to run the numbers to see if Ichiro is as valuable in their scoring system as he is in 5x5. You might just find that a guy with a single-digit homer figure and 50 RBIs doesn't quite hang with the big boys at the position.
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> Because of owners' schedule conflicts, last weekend was the only available time for one of my leagues to hold its auction. Because so much is left to be decided over the next month, owners seemed more willing to pay top dollar for guys guaranteed playing time. That, and the fact that Seattle's roster isn't exactly brimming with talent, kept many Mariners from being selected, even in a mixed league with 384 roster spots. As opening day grows closer, owners might find some $1 values here as roles become clearer.

<p><b>Position Battle:</b> Speaking of roles, let's examine that closer competition. If you're a reliever on this roster, you pretty much have a chance to close. Mark Lowe, Roy Corcoran and Tyler Walker all are considered "the favorite" by one expert or another. David Aardsma and his high 90s heat might merit consideration. Randy Messenger has caught the manager's eye with a strong spring. And if all else fails, there's always Miguel Batista. Again, maybe the picture will be clearer later this month, but right now, the risk of wasting a pick on a Seattle "closer" who ends up in middle relief is too high.
<p><b>Prospect Watch:</B> The M's not only lack top-end talent in the big leagues, but the farm also isn't stockpiled with studs. The franchise had four players on Baseball America's Top 100 prospects list for '09, but the highest was 57th (Double-A outfielder Greg Halman, who's still a year away). Meanwhile, one of the players Seattle traded to acquire Erik Bedard (pitcher Chris Tillman) is 22nd. Ouch! Jeff Clement and Wladimir Balentien were highly touted prospects heading into last season, and the team is still hoping to see more from them. But don't go into '09 thinking the Mariners have someone hiding in the minors who'll become an instant fantasy hit. They don't.
