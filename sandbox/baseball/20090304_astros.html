<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Astros.</i>

<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<P>Ready for one of those quick, quirky stats that elicits a big, "Really?"
<p>The Houston Astros have finished either first or second in the NL Central in 12 of the 15 years of the division's existence.  
<P>Last year wasn't one of those years, but Houston was very much alive in the wild card race in September en route to a third-place finish. Mercurial manager Cecil Cooper is back, and the Astros return most of the bats. Heavy hitters Lance Berkman and Carlos Lee can be scooped up in the first three rounds again. They've combined for 123 homers and 427 RBIs the past two seasons. Hunter Pence, Miguel Tejada, Michael Bourn and Kazuo Matsui all are excellent fantasy specialists.
<P>Roy Oswalt, who won 17 games, anchors the pitching staff. Jose Valverde racked up 44 saves in his first season with Houston and maintained a serviceable ERA (3.38). 
<P>The Astros have all the key ingredients for another winning season -- they've had just two losing seasons since 1992. Will it be enough to keep up with the Cubs?

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>Will the real Hunter Pence please stand up?</b> 
<p>Pence was one of the most attractive players heading into '08; he went in the fifth round of our experts' mock draft that season. Pence, however, hit just .269 with 11 stolen bases. He did hit 25 homers, but he also struck out 124 times. 
<P>Pence had solid power splits before and after the break, but he was a streaky hitter who bounced around the order. As a result, Pence fell to the last pick in the seventh round of our latest mock draft.  
<P>Owners who draft Pence there are taking a mild risk. If he can split the difference between his '07 (.322 BA) and '08 batting averages and run a little more, he'll be an ideal fit as a No. 3 outfielder. But that's assuming an awful lot. 
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Lance Berkman. Berkman came out swinging in '08, hitting .303-8-25 in April and .471-9-22 in May. But Berkman's totals were leveled off after a sour September (.171-2-12). He still managed to hit .312-29-106 with a career-high 18 stolen bases. Berkman remains a points-league pinball machine; he hit 46 doubles with an OPS of .987. The fact Berkman has played in 150-plus games in each of the last three seasons puts him among the best fantasy OF options.  
<br/><b>Others:</b> Carlos Lee, Hunter Pence.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Miguel Tejada. Tejada survived Mitchell Report allegations last year, but now he's in trouble for allegedly lying to congressional investigators about steroid use in baseball. Not that his first season in the National League was one to remember. He hit .283, his lowest average since '03. He also hit 13 homers with 66 RBIs, his lowest totals since '98. Tejada could be the inverse of Edgar Renteria -- good in the AL but bad in the NL. It doesn't help that Tejada turns 35 in May ... we think.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Aaron Boone, J.R. Towles.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Kazuo Matsui. Injuries (one was particularly embarrassing) derailed Matsui's first season with the Astros, but he still hit .293 with 20 stolen bases and scored 58 runs in 96 games. Hitting leadoff for Houston has its privileges, especially in Minute Maid Park. We just wish Matsui could stay healthy. He's cleared the 100-game mark only twice in six seasons. Knowing that, you might be able to grab him as a late-rounder for the MI spot. He's a proven producer when healthy.
<br/><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Michael Bourn. Bourn appeared on his way to 70 stolen bases last season after swiping 24 bags through May. Bourn, however, managed just 17 stolen bases the rest of the season. The old "you can't steal first base" adage is in play. Bourn must develop more consistency/patience at the plate. Despite the light bat, Bourn is worth drafting as a one-category specialist in all formats. He's one of just nine players who stole 40-plus bases in '08.

</table>
<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B> 
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Roy Oswalt. How dominant was Oswalt after the break? Besides the 10-2 record and 2.24 ERA, Oswalt allowed one earned run or less in eight of 12 starts. That included a three-start stretch in September where he allowed no runs in 26.1 innings. Oswalt did struggle in the first half (7-8, 4.56), and he'll turn 32 in August. Oswalt also has five straight seasons of 200-plus innings on his arm's odometer. Be cautious, but don't be afraid to scoop up Oswalt between Rounds 8-10.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Jose Valverde.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Mike Hampton. Hampton made 30-plus starts from 1997-2003. The last two seasons, however, are a much different story. He made just 25 starts with the Braves since '05, and that includes missing two full seasons with elbow injuries. His offseason featured a battle with an irregular heartbeat. Hampton showed shades of his former self last September (1-2, 3.79, 21 Ks), but Minute Maid Park isn't exactly the place to revive a career. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Brandon Backe.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Wandy Rodriguez. Rodriguez, who carried a 2.99 ERA and 1.20 WHIP at home in '08, doesn't mind pitching at Minute Maid. If you can get past the less-than-mediocre win total (nine in each of the last three seasons), Rodriguez appears to be a thrifty, late-round bargain. He has averaged about 145 Ks over the past two seasons with a WHIP of 1.32. Consider him a low-risk buy. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Brian Moehler. 
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> LaTroy Hawkins. The well-traveled Hawkins took refuge in Houston after being traded by the Yankees. Hawkins delivered in a setup role. He allowed just one earned run in 24 appearances, while converting 12 holds with 25 Ks in 21 innings for Houston. Hawkins easily could regress -- he did have a 5.71 ERA before the trade and he has played for six different teams since '05. For now, however, he's a points-league play.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</B>
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> A lot of owners are going to jump on Yankees starter A.J. Burnett ($6.6M). Why not take Oswalt ($6.25M), who is ranked one spot lower, instead? The two had comparable statistics in '08. Oswalt had one less victory but a better ERA and WHIP and more SNP/G. Oswalt is a little more consistent, and a lot less injured.

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> Given the choice between Carlos Lee and Lance Berkman, you'll want to stick with Berkman. Of the 13 players who hit 40-plus doubles and 25-plus homers last season, only Albert Pujols drew more walks than Berkman. Of that same group, Berkman was tied for the highest average with Kevin Youkilis at .312. Lee offers plenty of power, but Berkman has more across-the-board value in this format. 
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> Don't think Jose Valverde is worth a projected $24? Valverde is sixth in the league with 109 saves over the past three seasons. Plus, owners will be targeting the closers in front of him -- Mariano Rivera ($28), Brad Lidge ($28) and Francisco Rodriguez ($27) -- so he could slip under the radar. You may be able to get a 40-save guy at a discount if you nominate Valverde before the bigger names.

<p><b>Position Battle:</b> The Astros replaced Ty Wigginton with Aaron Boone at third base. Not exactly an optimum upgrade. Boone has hit .256 with an average of six homers and 34 RBIs over the past three seasons with three different teams. He'll also face competition from journeyman Geoff Blum. This situation screams platoon.
<p><b>Lineup Change:</b> Blum might be useful even if he doesn't catch on at third base. If the Astros decide to part ways with Miguel Tejada at any point during the season to avoid the constant barrage of bad publicity, Blum would gain importance once again. Blum hit .240-14-53 in 114 games in '08. He'll have constant value in NL-only leagues, but the journeyman infielder isn't much help in mixed formats.
