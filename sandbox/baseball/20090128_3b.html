<p><b><li><a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/rankings/3b/>Complete 3B rankings</a></b>
<P>It's true what they say: You don't know what you got 'til it's gone. Take third base, for example, where the story isn't who's here -- but who isn't. With Miguel Cabrera and Ryan Braun no longer third base-eligible (in leagues that use 15-plus games as the standard), the elite options at the hot corner are becoming scarce.
<P>New York's Alex Rodriguez and David Wright are at the top of the heap, but you'll need a top-five pick in any league to land one of these versatile sluggers. After them, the ride will feel like a 10-story drop with a couple of loop-de-loops mixed in.
<P>The second tier consists of Evan Longoria and Aramis Ramirez, and here you're choosing between a young player with considerable upside and a proven, yet underrated slugger. We're leaning toward the reigning AL Rookie of the Year, but it's only by a hair.
<P>The next group of players includes Chipper Jones, Kevin Youkilis and Garrett Atkins. With Jones, you'll get near-elite production when he's healthy, but he hasn't played in more than 136 games in a season since 2004. Plus, it would be silly to count on him repeating his MLB-leading .364 average from a year ago.
<P>Youkilis is a nice consolation prize because he's first base-eligible and showed remarkable consistency last season. (See our <a href= http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/experts/george-winkler/20090126.html>first base preview</a> for more on Youkilis.) 
<P>Then you get to Atkins, whose home-road splits last season were cause for concern. Once Atkins got outside Coors Field, his batting average dropped from .342 to .233. Look out below, indeed.
<P>From there, it's Aubrey Huff, Jorge Cantu and Melvin Mora, a trio whose stat lines last year are hard to believe -- unless you owned them last season.
<P>Our advice for drafting a third baseman is to try to get one early, as in the first four rounds of a standard mixed-league draft, or else you'll need a strong stomach to get through the later rounds.
<P><b>3 UP</b>
<P><b>1. Evan Longoria, Rays.</b> Longoria came up in early April and hit .273 with three homers and 10 RBIs in 17 games. Then he flipped the switch and hit .300-plus in June, July and August before his average dipped to .239 in September (after a wrist injury). Still, the tools are there for him to be a fixture in fantasy lineups for years to come.
<P><b>2. Ian Stewart, Rockies.</b> Garrett Atkins could play more first base this season because Todd Helton is having problems staying healthy, so a permanent spot could open up for Stewart in 2009. While Stewart struck out a lot (94 Ks in 81 games last year), he hit 10 homers and had 41 RBIs in just 266 at-bats. If he gets a starting job, we like the 23-year-old's chances to produce bigger numbers with more chances in Coors Field. 
<P><b>3. Mat Gamel, Brewers.</b> The 23-year-old has been rising rapidly through the minors and hit .329 with 19 homers, 96 RBIs and 96 runs scored for Double-A Huntsville last season. If Bill Hall continues his slide, Milwaukee could opt for Gamel. Keep him in mind for an in-season pickup. 
<P><b>3 DOWN</b>
<P><b>1. Mike Lowell, Red Sox.</b> It seems we've thrown dirt on him before only to see him rise up and slap us silly. But Lowell had offseason surgery to repair a torn tendon in his right hip, so it will be interesting to see how the 34-year-old bounces back. It's no longer smart to count on him as your No. 1 option.  
<P><b>2. Edwin Encarnacion, Reds.</b> His 26 dingers were impressive, but he regressed in average, RBIs and stolen bases. There were far too many wild swings en route to his .251 average. He's only 26, so the potential for a breakout season remains. But we're starting to lose patience.
<P><b>3. Bill Hall, Brewers.</b> It's been confirmed: Hall's 2006 season when he hit .270 with 35 home runs and 85 RBIs was indeed a fluke. After two seasons in which he failed to top 15 homers, 63 RBIs or a .254 average, he's now in danger of being replaced in Milwaukee.
<P><b>BUYER BEWARE</b>
<P>As we said before, be careful about overpaying for Aubrey Huff, Jorge Cantu or Melvin Mora. All three were revelations to fantasy owners last year, but a quick glance at their histories suggests they could be in for a fall.
<P>Huff, who hit .304 with 32 home runs and 108 RBIs last season for Baltimore, hadn't put up numbers close to that since '04 with Tampa Bay. We already discussed him in the first baseman overview, but can't emphasize enough that he probably won't match last year's numbers.
<P>Cantu hit .277 with 29 homers, 95 RBIs and 92 runs scored for the Marlins, but he hadn't seen production like that since '05 with Tampa Bay. In between were a couple of mediocre seasons, one in which he was a platoon player for the Reds. With a batting average that was all over the board from month to month last season, it's difficult to believe he can produce consistently.
<P>As for Mora, it was downright amazing that he needed just 135 games to get 104 RBIs last season, but he hadn't produced numbers like that since his career season in '04. Plus, he'll be 37 on opening day.
<P><b>AUCTION STRATEGY</b>
<P>There's no easy way around trying to land Alex Rodriguez or David Wright in an auction league. Because of the absence of many elite options at this position, the bidding wars could be fierce for the two New York sluggers.
<P>That said, if you want Wright it would be wise to nominate A-Rod first. That way, at least one owner will be taken out of the mix and the high-end price will be set.
<P>After A-Rod and Wright, don't wait too long to jump into the bidding. There could be a lull in spending where you could nab a guy like Kevin Youkilis, but when it's down to the likes of Garrett Atkins, expect prices to rise as owners get desperate to land one of the final upper-tier options.
<P><b>BOUNCE-BACK CANDIDATES</b>
<P>They were ballyhooed as prospects, but the shine is off Ryan Zimmerman and Alex Gordon after a couple of seasons that left fantasy owners wanting more. However, it's important to remember both guys will be younger than 26 on opening day and have time to turn things around.
Zimmerman is coming off wrist and shoulder problems last season, so improved health should go a long way toward bringing back his fantasy value. Meanwhile, Gordon hit .311 in September and has the ability to add double-digit steals to the mix.
<P><b>AVERAGE JOE</b>
<P> <table cellpadding=3 cellspacing=1 border=0 width=100% bgcolor=CCCCCC class=v11>

</table>
<font class=text>
<P><b>Casey Blake, Dodgers.</b> Blake not only looks like the average guy you'd run into at the mall, but acts like it, too. In 2008 for the Indians and Dodgers, Blake hit .274 with 21 home runs, 81 RBIs, 71 runs and three stolen bases. You should be able to do better than Blake in a standard mixed league, where he isn't more than a late-round bench pick.
