<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Blue Jays.</i>

<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>The Yankees spent nearly half a trillion dollars on free agents, and the Red Sox and Rays both smartly addressed needs. Meanwhile, their AL East counterparts, the Blue Jays, basically did nothing this offseason. That is, unless you consider adding catcher Michael Barrett and signing Kevin Millar to a minor league deal to be significant upgrades.
<p>Toronto is going the younger route by giving everyday jobs to prospects like Travis Snider and Adam Lind and hoping the combination of youth and Roy Halladay will be enough to improve on last season's 86 wins. Trouble is A.J. Burnett is now a Yankee, Shaun Marcum is out for the season after Tommy John surgery, and Dustin McGowan (shoulder surgery) isn't expected back until May at the earliest.
<p>That means a team that led the majors in ERA in 2008 might need to rely more on offense to win in '09. But when the only semi-reliable threats in the lineup are Vernon Wells and Alex Rios, it looks like a tough season is ahead for the Blue Jays. As for their individuals, there are a few worth tracking in fantasy leagues. In fact, fantasy baseball is one of the few reasons to watch the Blue Jays this year.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>Is there any pitching beyond Roy Halladay?</b> 
<p>The Blue Jays were a sneaky source for good fantasy pitching last season. Everyone, of course, knew about Halladay, who posted 20 wins and the majors' seventh-best ERA -- and was an absolute beast in head-to-head leagues with 246 innings. But what made Toronto good for fantasy owners was having Burnett (18 wins), Jesse Litsch (13 wins) and Marcum (nine wins) backing up big Roy.
<p>Now, thanks to offseason moves and injuries, Litsch is the only pitcher left standing from that group, and even he is a questionable option in fantasy leagues. There's no guarantee Litsch will get 13 wins again with Toronto's lack of offensive punch, and if the wins decrease there's not a lot to like. That's because Litsch's strikeout rate (4.7 career K/9 ratio) is not impressive.
<P>After Halladay and Litsch, the Blue Jays will likely go with David Purcey, Casey Janssen (who is coming back from a torn labrum) and Scott Richmond -- at least until McGowan can return from a frayed labrum. So unless you're in an AL-only league, the answer is "No" to the above question.   
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Alex Rios. You know it's bad when even in the "Must Own" section there's a guy who has some question marks. Fantasy owners were expecting five-category production from Rios last year, but what they got was closer to three. Rios' home runs declined from 24 to 15, and while his steals increased from 17 to 32, his RBI total of 79 was disappointing. However, he still hit .291 and scored 91 runs, making him an intriguing upside pick once the elite outfielders are off the board.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Vernon Wells.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Scott Rolen. The average fantasy owner might come across Rolen's name on a rankings list and feel comfortable drafting him because of what he did with the Cardinals. But Rolen proved last season in Toronto that those days are long gone. Instead of a 20-homer, 100-RBI threat (which he last came close to accomplishing in 2006) Rolen has settled into being a guy who can give you 15 homers and 70 RBIs max. Too bad hustle points don't count in fantasy.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Lyle Overbay, Marco Scutaro.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Travis Snider. The Blue Jays want to give their top prospect a chance in left field, so he becomes the wild card to their season. If Snider can build on his call-up when he hit .301 with two home runs and 13 RBIs in 24 games, fantasy owners will have a potential steal. But relying on young hitters is risky in fantasy leagues, so there's no need to use more than a late-round flier on Snider. At that point, he'll appear more appealing than some of the ho-hum veterans available.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Adam Lind.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Aaron Hill. Hill put together a good season in 2007 when he had 17 home runs and 78 RBIs, but a concussion ended his '08 campaign after just 55 disappointing games. AL-only leaguers would love to get the '07 version of Hill back, which is why you should keep an eye on Hill in spring training. If he proves he's 100 percent recovered from post-concussion syndrome, then he'll be worth a late-round flier. But he's a risk-reward pick. There's no guarantee he'll get back to those '07 numbers, so there's no reason to reach for him.

<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Roy Halladay. He is an excellent fantasy pitcher, but it's important to note that Halladay is coming off an exceptional season even by his standards. While he's definitely worthy of being your fantasy ace, Halladay shouldn't be expected to log 20 wins, 246 innings and 206 strikeouts like he did last season. Adjust your projections a bit lower and you will be happy with what you get from him with the third- or fourth-round pick in your draft. <br/><b>Others:</b> B.J. Ryan.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Dustin McGowan. McGowan won 12 games in 2007 and also had 144 strikeouts in 169.2 innings. He did that in 27 starts. So, as you can see, he can bring fantasy value to your team even without a full season's worth of appearances. The trouble is McGowan isn't healthy after having shoulder surgery, and nobody can seem to pinpoint when he'll be back (some are estimating May at the earliest). McGowan could be someone you stash away in a DL spot, but don't use anything more on him. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Casey Janssen.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> David Purcey. Here's a 6-5 lefthander who was a first-round pick in 2004 but fell out of favor. He bounced back last season with a good K/9 rate in the majors (8.03), but he also had a poor ERA (5.54) and WHIP (1.48). If the Jays give him a rotation spot, Purcey will be worth a flier in AL-only leagues just to see if he can improve his command.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Jesse Litsch.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Scott Richmond. He's a workmanlike pitcher with a sinker and cut fastball. If McGowan can't come back from shoulder surgery, Richmond could earn a rotation spot for at least a month or two. In five starts last season, Richmond went 1-3 with a 4.00 ERA and 1.26 WHIP. That's nothing to write home about, but the fact he could have a rotation job could be of interest to AL-only leaguers.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b>
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> B.J. Ryan might seem like a smartly priced reliever in Ultimate Fantasy Baseball at $4.15M. After all, last season he averaged 24.88 SN points per game, which was more than Brian Fuentes (23.54), who will cost more ($4.7M) this year. But without many quality starters to get the ball to Ryan with a lead, expect Ryan's saves total to decrease this year. Fuentes might actually be the better pick after his move to the Angels.

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> According to our <a href= http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/analyzer/>Player Analyzer</a>, Vernon Wells ranked 44th among outfielders in 5x5 value last season, but just 60th in points leagues. While Wells' .300 average will help you in 5x5 leagues, it doesn't come with much punch for point leaguers because he had just 22 doubles and 20 home runs.
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> At $28 in mixed leagues, Roy Halladay is  slotted comfortably behind top-shelf options like Tim Lincecum ($35) and Johan Santana ($34). Therefore, you can still get a stud pitcher and have some extra dollars for elsewhere. Plus, Halladay is not priced so dangerously close to the drop between elite and second-tier pitchers that you'll feel the need to panic and overpay for him.

<p><b>Position Battle:</B> This isn't as much a position battle as it is a mess. The addition of Michael Barrett gives Toronto the option to use him at first base or designated hitter against lefthanded pitchers. That way the Blue Jays could have Barrett and Rod Barajas in the lineup at the same time (Imagine the possibilities!). This is good for Barrett, but it could be bad for either Lyle Overbay or Travis Snider, a couple of lefty bats who would sit down when Barrett is gallivanting from position to position. 
<p><b>Ballpark factor:</b> Don't tell Fred McGriff or Kelly Gruber, but Rogers Centre has dropped among the pitcher-friendly parks in our <a href= http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/ballparks/index.html>Ballpark Power Poll</a>. This is due in part to the fact the Blue Jays' ranked 24th in home runs last season and because of their excellent pitching. Expect the ballpark rating to inch up with Toronto's rotation in flux. Basically, you should just be happy that your hitters get to face some of the pitchers Toronto will be forced to use this year.
