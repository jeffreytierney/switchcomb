<p><i>This is the first in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Phillies.</i>
<p><b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/phillies/index.html>Phillies team page</a></b><br/>
<b><li> <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/phillies/statistics/projections/>Phillies stat projections</a></b>
<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>The cork from the champagne bottle was barely dry and already the Phillies were facing the first obstacle to a World Series repeat. On Nov. 24, Chase Utley underwent surgery on his right hip, putting his status for opening day in question. We'll have more on Utley in the "Burning Question" section below, but it doesn't take a genius to say there'd be a drop-off from Utley to Eric Bruntlett or Marcus Giles.
<p>But even if Utley makes it back in time to start the season, the Phillies still will have a slightly different look in 2009. Gone is left fielder Pat Burrell, who signed a two-year deal to become Tampa Bay's designated hitter. Enter former Mariner Raul Ibanez, who might enjoy a slight boost in production now that he's in a better lineup and playing home games in a much more hitter-friendly ballpark.
<p>Ibanez will be an upgrade over Burrell in 5x5 NL-only leagues because of a better batting average. Plus, he's somewhat underappreciated in fantasy leagues, making him a potential bargain in his new home. However, Ibanez's presence causes an interesting situation for manager Charlie Manuel. The Phillies are loaded with lefthanded bats, particularly in the middle of their lineup. How they stack up is something for fantasy owners to watch this spring.

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>How much will Chase Utley play?</b> 
<p>When Utley had his surgery, which was described as an arthroscopic debridement of the labrum and a bony lesion that was present, the recovery time was set at 4-6 months. That puts Utley's return date anywhere from March 25 to May 25. I'm no doctor, but I did look up debridement, and it means "the removal of lacerated, devitalized or contaminated tissue," according to Merriam-Webster. 
<p>It could be a positive sign that the Phillies haven't made a move yet to bolster the middle of their infield. Maybe they think Utley can make it back by opening day, or shortly thereafter, so they'll just try to get by. Utley is reportedly doing well and has set opening day as his goal, but until we see him on the field, his return date is speculative.
<p>However, because a return by opening day is still possible, we've decided to keep Utley at the top of our 2B rankings. Keep in mind that Utley missed a month in '07 and still finished with 103 RBIs, 104 runs scored, a .332 batting average and 22 home runs. He's such a good hitter and at such a weak position that he could make up for missed time in a hurry.
<p>In fact, if Utley was 100 percent healthy, he'd be a lock as a first-round pick in any fantasy league. But since he's not, expect him to fall to the second round. If he lasts beyond that, you have a potential bargain depending upon how he looks this spring. 
<p><b>HITTERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Ryan Howard. Sure, you're going to take a hit in batting average in 5x5 leagues by drafting Howard in the first round. But guys who are a virtual lock to hit 40 homers, drive in 130 runs and score 100 runs are just as rare -- some would argue more so -- than those who steal 40-plus bases. As long as you balance out a Howard pick with some speed and batting average help later, you'll be fine. And just think of the advantage you'll have in home runs, which have become more difficult to get since steroid testing went into effect.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Jimmy Rollins, Chase Utley, Shane Victorino.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Jayson Werth. He's everything you'd want in a mid-round outfielder because of his 20-20 potential, so why is Werth landing here? Simply put, it's because of his injury history. Last season was the first time Werth played more than 102 games. His five seasons before that had been mostly injury-shortened campaigns when he didn't reach his potential. Now that we've seen what he can do it's exciting, but he still needs to prove he can stay healthy and productive in the long term to be a lock.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Pedro Feliz.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Raul Ibanez. He's not a true sleeper, but there aren't many unknown quantities on a World Series championship team. He's certainly not a sexy pick, which is why you'll be able to get him cheaper than comparable players like Milton Bradley. But Ibanez is much more reliable than Bradley. Ibanez has hit .289 or better in six of the past seven seasons. He also has topped 20 homers five times in that span and bettered 100 RBIs four times. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> None.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Chris Coste was a decent, under-the-radar pick in NL-only leagues last season, but Ronny Paulino's presence puts Coste's value in question. Adding to the situation is that Carlos Ruiz remains the No. 1 catcher mostly because of defensive reasons. Plus, catcher Lou Marson is rated the Phillies' third-best prospect by <i>Baseball America</i>. Now, NL-only owners have a trickier situation to watch.

<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B>
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Cole Hamels. The World Series MVP answered durability questions by going 4-0 with a 1.80 ERA in the postseason. That was after he pitched 227.1 innings in 33 starts during the regular season. The heavy workload shouldn't affect Hamels given that he has had back-to-back seasons of 187-plus innings and should be able to handle it. Last season, Hamels' 14-10 record was somewhat "hard-luck," given that he had a 3.09 ERA and 1.08 WHIP. If he pitches like that again, expect more wins.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Brad Lidge.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Jamie Moyer. The 46-year-old lefty landed a two-year deal with the Phillies that could earn him $20 million. There's no need for you to overpay like that. Sure, Moyer had 16 wins last season and posted a 3.71 ERA and 1.33 WHIP. But those were his best numbers in those categories in years. He could revert to 2007 form when he had a 5.01 ERA and 1.44 WHIP. In other words, be careful about chasing wins here.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Kyle Kendrick.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Brett Myers. After spending most of 2007 in the bullpen, Myers returned to a starting role in '08 to some degree of success. He overcame a rough start by going 7-4 with a 3.06 ERA and 1.17 WHIP after the All-Star break. Myers has shown he can rack up good strikeout numbers once he gets his legs under him. He's worth adding at the end of your rotation for use during his hot streaks.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Joe Blanton.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> J.A. Happ. The 6-6 lefthander had an International League-leading 151 strikeouts in 135 innings at Triple-A. He parlayed that into a late-season call-up with the Phillies when he went 1-0 with 26 strikeouts in 32 innings. He'll likely compete with Kyle Kendrick and prospect Carlos Carrasco for the Phillies' No. 5 starter spot. NL-only owners should take notice.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b>
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> At $5.75 million, Shane Victorino is a nice addition to your Ultimate Fantasy Baseball outfield. In 2008, Victorino averaged 1.09 more SN points per game than Tampa Bay's Carl Crawford ($7 million), and scored more total points (1,661 to 1,247) than Vernon Wells ($6.3 million).

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> Jimmy Rollins and Ryan Howard have slightly less value in points leagues because their dominance in particular 5x5 categories (stolen bases and home runs, respectively) is somewhat downplayed. Don't get me wrong: Rollins and Howard are still among the elite at their respective positions, but you won't have to spend a first- or perhaps even a second-round pick to get either of them in a points league.
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> Prepare to spend big bucks to land one of the Phillies' prized hitters. Even an injured Chase Utley or a Jimmy Rollins coming off a down season figure to command top dollar because they are at scarce positions. But the Phillies' top players (Utley, Rollins, Ryan Howard, Cole Hamels, Brad Lidge and Shane Victorino) are all worth it. The combination of a hitter-friendly ballpark and good lineup protection is great for their hitters. Meanwhile, the pitchers will be put in position to grab wins and saves.

<p><b>Ballpark Factor:</b> Citizens Bank Park dropped from first place to sixth in our latest <a href= http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/ballparks/index.html>Ballpark Power Poll</a>. But that move was made in part because the Phillies were better at holding down opponents' run totals. Philadelphia is still a favorable park for hitters, especially for the home team. If you're facing a tough decision, the Phillies' favorable ballpark could be a factor that tips the scales in their hitters' advantage.
<p><b>Injury Report:</b> Besides Utley, the Phillies also will be watching Pedro Feliz's injury recovery this spring. Feliz had back surgery in late November with an expected recovery time of 2-3 months. That means he should be full speed by late February. Still, back problems have a tendency to linger with baseball players. Before drafting Feliz, NL-only leaguers should watch to see if Philadelphia grabs another third baseman. It could be an indication of how they feel Feliz's rehabilitation is going.
