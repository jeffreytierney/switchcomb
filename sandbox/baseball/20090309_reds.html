<p><i>This is the latest in a series examining the fantasy prospects of every major league team. Today, a look at the Reds.</i>

<p><b>WHAT YOU MISSED</b>
<p>Dusty Baker's first season as manager netted just two more victories for Cincinnati than 2007. The Reds traded sluggers Adam Dunn and Ken Griffey Jr. just before the deadline, and ace Aaron Harang waddled through a 6-17 nightmare. 
<P>Now, the good news ... 
<P>Cincinnati boasts a ton of young talent. Brandon Phillips produced a 20-20 line despite missing most of September. Jay Bruce and Joey Votto are middle-round picks with All-Star-before-you-know-it potential. Baker also brought in Willy Taveras, who led the majors with 68 stolen bases. Power-hitting catcher Ramon Hernandez, back in the NL after three seasons in Baltimore, is an intriguing late-round pick.
<P>On the mound, the Reds fell into an ace in Edinson Volquez, who finished in the top 10 in wins, strikeouts and ERA. If Harang can bounce back, the top of the rotation will be solid. You already know the risks associated with Bronson Arroyo, Johnny Cueto, Micah Owings and Homer Bailey. Those risks haven't changed. 
<P>What has changed is the Reds have a reliable closer. Expect Francisco Cordero to be even better in his second year with Cincinnati.
<P>Expect the Reds to be better, too. They have the pieces to put together their first winning season since 2000. Now, can Baker deliver?

<p><b>BURNING QUESTION</b>
<p><b>Will Jay Bruce and Joey Votto emerge as fantasy elite?</b> 
<p>They better, considering the Reds traded Griffey and Dunn to make room for their prized prospects. Bruce received an extraordinary amount of hype after his first week in the majors, but later fell off a sharp learning curve. He still hit 21 homers with a .453 slugging percentage, and that included high marks at home. Bruce will be better in year two, and he deserves to be your No. 3 or No. 4 outfielder. 
<P>Votto, with a full season under his belt, is a little further along in development than Bruce. Votto's line was serviceable (.297-24-84), and he picked it up after the break (.321-11-44). Votto has a long way to go before being considered a top-five first baseman, but expect him to take big steps in the right direction. 
<p><b>HITTERS</B> 
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Brandon Phillips. Phillips took a small step back in '08, but he still managed 21 homers and 23 stolen bases despite missing most of September with a broken hand. Phillips doesn't mess around against lefties (.296-11-34). He's less productive against righties (.247-10-44), and that includes 73 strikeouts. Despite hot-and-cold streaks, Phillips remains a great fit at a thin position.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Jay Bruce, Joey Votto.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Edwin Encarnacion. Every year is supposedly "the year" for Encarnacion to break out. Encarnacion smacked 26 homers last season, but it amounted to just 68 RBIs. A good chunk of that came in April (seven HRs, 15 RBIs) and July (seven HRs, 11 RBIs). Encarnacion bored us otherwise, especially after the break. That's one awful line in September (.239-2-11). Encarnacion is a hot-and-cold play, but it's important to remember that he's still just a .266 lifetime hitter at a deep position. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Jerry Hairston Jr., Jeff Keppinger.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Ramon Hernandez. The veteran catcher averaged nearly 16 homers the last three seasons with Baltimore. He averaged 15 homers in two seasons with San Diego from 2004-05. Add the Great American Ball Park bonus, and it's not a stretch to say Hernandez could hit 20 homers if healthy. That alone would make him a top-10 catcher. It's a lot to ask for, but there's no harm in drafting Hernandez as a backup.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Chris Dickerson.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Willy Taveras. In a weekly head-to-head league, stolen-base wizard Taveras is a must-own player. He steals bases in binges; he had 12 games with two or more steals in '08. Remember his five-steal effort against the White Sox on June 14? Taveras can close out the stolen-base category for the week in your favor like no other player in the league. He's the perfect one-category specialist in Roto leagues, too.

</table>
<font class=text>
<p><B>PITCHERS</B> 
<p><b>Must Own:</b> Edinson Volquez. Volquez emerged as the unlikeliest of All-Star starters after racking up a 12-3 record with a 2.29 ERA and 126 strikeouts in the first half of '08. He cooled a bit after the break but finished with 17 wins, a 3.21 ERA and 206 strikeouts. His ERA was naturally higher at home (4.03 to 2.43), but still manageable. Owners still aren't completely sold, meaning you could snag Volquez between Rounds 8-10. Take advantage of the value.   
<br/><b>Others:</b> Francisco Cordero.
<p><b>Buyer Beware:</b> Bronson Arroyo. Arroyo seemed destined for a job in the fast-food business after giving up 10 runs in one inning against Toronto on June 24. Arroyo, however, let his hair down and went 8-4 with a 3.47 ERA after the break. While that is encouraging, the fact Arroyo has thrown 200-plus innings in each of the last four seasons is, at the very least, disconcerting. He'll be on waivers if you need him later. 
<br/><b>Others:</b> Homer Bailey.
<p><b>Sleeper:</b> Aaron Harang. Harang's season plunged off a cliff after he came in relief work on two day's rest in a marathon loss to the Padres on May 22. Harang took all the lumps afterward and finished 6-17 with a 4.78 ERA. His road split (2-10, 4.77 ERA) was particularly atrocious. Still we're talking about a guy who won 16 games with a sub-4.00 ERA and 200-plus strikeouts the previous two seasons. Don't write Harang off; just don't draft him too early expecting a complete return to form.
<br/><b>Others:</b> Micah Owings.
<p><b>Going deeper:</b> Johnny Cueto. Trumpets echoed from the heavens after Cueto's immaculate first week in the bigs, during which he allowed three runs in 13.1 innings while striking out 18. Cueto, however, plummeted back to Earth in a hurry. He finished 9-14 with a 4.81 ERA. Cueto is young, and he did rack up 158 strikeouts with just 68 walks in 174 innings. He's a better play in NL-only leagues and points leagues for now, but don't be afraid to grab him in the last round.

<p><B>TO KNOW LIST</b> 
<p><b>SN Games Tip:</b> Jerry Hairston Jr. ($3.5M) is one of those cheap, versatile players who can rack up points in Ultimate Fantasy Baseball. He's eligible at shortstop and outfield, and Baker loves keeping him in the lineup for his speed (15 SBs). It's hard to bank on Hairston duplicating last year's .326 average, but the fact he hit .410 at home in 37 games suggests he'll be more than just OK.

<p><b>Points League Pointer:</B> Cincinnati was the only team in the league to have four pitchers compile more than 150 strikeouts last season in Volquez (206), Arroyo (163), Cueto (158) and Harang (153). All four have excellent K-to-BB differentials, too. Volquez led the way at +113. Harang (+103), Arroyo (+95) and Cueto (+90) weren't too shabby. Take advantage of these splits in this format.
<p><b>Auction Advice:</b> Owners are going to drive up the price on second basemen Ian Kinsler, Dustin Pedroia and Chase Utley. As a result, Brandon Phillips should be attainable at or below face value. We've already told you Phillips is streaky, which might turn an owner or 10 off. Phillips, however, went 30-30 in '07 and is a strong bet to get there again if healthy. Make a strong play here.
<p><i>For the Reds' projected dollar values, <a href= http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/teams/reds/dollarvalues/>click here.</a></i>
<p><b>Position Battle:</b> Left field is up for grabs, and likely will stay that way into the first month of the season. Top prospect Chris Dickerson hit .304 in 31 games last season, mostly out of the leadoff spot. But the Reds brought in Jonny Gomes from Tampa Bay. Gomes hit 20 or more homers twice with the Rays, and you have to love his power potential at Cincy's hitter-friendly park. Hairston figures to pilfer a few starts, too. We'd like to see Dickerson win the job, but that's no sure thing.
<p><b>Ballpark Factor:</b> The Great American Ball Park is a renowned hitters park, but the pitchers are gaining a little ground. Cincinnati hit 103 homers at home in '08; the third straight year that total has dropped. Opponents also hit fewer homers for the third straight year at 111. Still, the Reds ranked seventh in the league with 187 homers and averaged 4.6 runs per game at home. Opponents scored 4.9 runs per game. In spite of the drop-off, the park still is ranked No. 2 in our <a href=http://fantasysource.sportingnews.com/baseball/ballparks/index.html>Ballpark Power Index</a>.
